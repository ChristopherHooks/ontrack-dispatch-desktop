## What Was Completed (Most Recent Sessions)

### Session 18 — Broker Intelligence + Lane Memory (complete)

**New service: `electron/main/brokerIntelligence.ts`**
- Fully deterministic — no AI, no schema changes; reads from existing `brokers` + `loads` + `drivers` tables
- `getBrokerIntelAll(db)` — per-broker score (0–100) + rating (Preferred / Strong / Neutral / Caution / Avoid) + caution_note; scoring: base 50 + RPM adj (±20 across ±$1.33/mi) + volume bonus (up to +15) + flag adj (Preferred+25, Slow Pay-20, Avoid-40, Blacklisted→0)
- `getLaneIntelAll(db)` — per origin_state/dest_state aggregates from Booked+ loads; strength: Strong (avgRpm≥2.50 AND loads≥3) / Average (avgRpm≥1.80 OR loads≥2) / Weak (else)
- `getDriverLaneFits(db, driverId)` — per driver lane history aggregates; fit: Strong Fit (≥2 loads AND avgRpm≥2.25) / Has History (≥1 load) / New Lane

**3 new IPC handlers:** `intel:allBrokers`, `intel:allLanes`, `intel:driverFit(driverId)`

**Preload:** `window.api.intel.{ allBrokers, allLanes, driverFit }` — all three added to preload namespace

**Types:** `BrokerRating`, `LaneStrength`, `DriverLaneFit`, `BrokerIntelRow`, `LaneIntelRow`, `DriverLaneFitRow` added to `models.ts` and imported in `global.d.ts`; `intel` namespace added to `Window.api`

**LoadMatch.tsx (`/loadmatch`):**
- Fetches `intel.allBrokers()` + `intel.allLanes()` on mount; fetches `intel.driverFit(driverId)` on driver select
- Each load card now shows intel chips below broker/pickup row: broker rating chip (Preferred=green / Neutral=gray / Caution=yellow / Avoid=red) + lane strength chip (Strong/Average/Weak) + driver fit chip (Strong Fit/Has History/New Lane)
- Booking workspace shows "Intelligence" section between load summary header and checklist — only when intel data exists for the selected load; shows broker name + rating + history, lane + strength + avg RPM, driver fit + run count; caution_note shown in yellow when applicable
- All lookups are client-side (no extra IPC per load selection)

**BrokerDrawer.tsx:**
- Performance section header now shows rating badge (Preferred/Strong/Neutral/Caution/Avoid) computed client-side from already-fetched `completedLoads.length`, `avgRpm`, and `broker.flag` — identical scoring logic, no new IPC needed

**Operations.tsx:**
- Profit Radar "Top Broker Lanes by RPM" lane chips now include a lane strength label (Strong=green / Average=orange / Weak=gray) computed client-side from `avgRpm` + `loads` — no new data fetch

### Session 17 — Active Load Timeline + Check Call Engine + Duplicate Group Fix (complete)

**Duplicate marketing_groups fix (migration 015):**
- Root cause: `marketing_groups` had no UNIQUE constraint, so `INSERT OR IGNORE` never actually skipped duplicates; every HTML import or seed call added fresh rows
- Migration 015: deletes duplicate rows (keeps lowest id per LOWER(TRIM(name))); creates `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_marketing_groups_name ON marketing_groups (LOWER(TRIM(name)))` — runs automatically on next launch
- `createMarketingGroup()` updated to `INSERT OR IGNORE` and returns the existing row on a name collision

**Active Load Timeline + Check Call Engine (new system):**
- Migration 016: `load_timeline_events` table — `id, load_id (FK→loads, CASCADE), event_type, label, scheduled_at, completed_at, notes, created_at`; two indexes (load_id, scheduled_at)

**New `loadTimelineRepo.ts` (backend service):**
- `listTimelineEvents(db, loadId)` — all events sorted by scheduled_at/created_at ASC
- `addTimelineEvent(db, loadId, eventType, label, scheduledAt, notes)` — raw insert
- `completeTimelineEvent(db, id, notes?)` — sets completed_at to now
- `deleteTimelineEvent(db, id)` — removes event
- `scheduleDefaultEvents(db, loadId, newStatus, pickupDate, deliveryDate)` — idempotent; auto-schedules check calls based on status:
  - Booked → Load Booked (status), Driver Dispatched (check_call +1h), Pickup Check Call (pickup day 08:00)
  - Picked Up → Picked Up (status), Mid-Route Check Call (midpoint of pickup/delivery), Delivery ETA Confirm (delivery day 10:00)
  - In Transit → In Transit (status), Delivery ETA Confirm (delivery day 10:00)
  - Delivered → Delivered (status), POD Request (check_call +30min)
  - Completed → Load Completed (status)
- `applyStatusChange(db, loadId, newStatus, notes)` — updates load status + adds event + auto-schedules next events
- `initLoadTimeline(db, loadId)` — initializes events for a newly booked load (idempotent, checks for existing events first)
- `getActiveLoads(db)` — Booked/Picked Up/In Transit loads with driver/broker info + next pending event label and time
- `getUpcomingCheckCalls(db, n)` — next N uncompleted check_call events across active loads; used by Operations panel

**New IPC handlers (10 new channels):**
- `timeline:activeLoads`, `timeline:upcomingCalls`, `timeline:events`
- `timeline:addEvent`, `timeline:completeEvent`, `timeline:deleteEvent`
- `timeline:statusChange`, `timeline:initLoad`
- `timeline:generateMessage` (async, Claude Haiku) — generates check-in text, broker update, POD request, or delivery confirm (150 max tokens, fails gracefully if no API key)

**Preload:** `window.api.timeline.*` for all 9 timeline methods

**New `ActiveLoads.tsx` page at `/activeloads`:**
- Two-panel layout: left (load list) / right (timeline + actions)
- Left: active load cards — ref, status badge, route, driver name, next event label + time (overdue = red + warning icon)
- Right panel (shown when a load is selected):
  - Load header: route, status badge, driver, phone, broker, rate, miles + "Call Driver" tel: link
  - Next Action panel: highlights first pending event; overdue events show red; "Mark Done" + "Call Driver" buttons
  - Timeline: pending events (up-top) + completed events (below a divider); each row has check/clock/alert icon; hover shows "Done" + delete buttons; inline "Add note" input
  - Status Update: "Mark as [NextStatus]" button + optional "Mark Delivered" shortcut; note input + confirm/cancel
  - Message Helpers: 4 quick-generate AI buttons (Driver Check-In, Broker Update, Request POD, Delivery Confirm); generated text shown with Copy button
- Auto-inits timeline (calls `initLoad`) if load has no events when first selected
- Clicking a load card when already selected = deselect

**Operations.tsx integration:**
- Added `checkCalls` state (CheckCallRow[]); fetches independently via `window.api.timeline.upcomingCalls(6)` — does not block main render
- New "Upcoming Check Calls" section appears between KPI strip and Profit Radar, but only when active loads have check call events; overdue events show red; clicking any card navigates to `/activeloads`

**Sidebar:** "Active Loads" added as 3rd nav item (Activity icon) between Load Match and Dispatcher

**Models:** `TimelineEvent`, `ActiveLoadRow`, `CheckCallRow` added to `models.ts` and imported in `global.d.ts`

### Session 16 — Load Match + Booking Workspace (complete)

**Load Match page (new guided dispatch workflow):**
- `src/pages/LoadMatch.tsx` — new three-panel page at `/loadmatch`
- Left panel: available drivers (all Active with no current load), showing name, home base, number of loads matched; clicking a driver selects them
- Center panel: candidate loads for the selected driver, sourced from existing `scanner.recommendLoads()` — ranked by RPM and deadhead; each card shows origin→dest, rate, RPM (color-coded), loaded miles, deadhead estimate, broker name + flag, pickup date, Strong/Good/Fair/Weak score badge
- Right panel (Booking Workspace): load summary header, 6-step booking checklist with progress bar, rate analysis table (always visible), deterministic negotiation opener (computed from RPM vs $2.50/mi floor), optional AI-enhanced script button, Book Load action button (glows orange when all checklist steps are checked), success screen with "Book another load" / "Back to Operations" options
- Navigating from Operations Profit Radar idle driver rows now deep-links to `/loadmatch?driverId=X` — driver is auto-selected on arrival

**New IPC endpoint:**
- `loadMatch:nego` — takes `{ rate, miles, rpm, deadheadMiles, origin, dest, brokerName, driverName }`, calls Claude Haiku for a 2-sentence negotiation assessment + word-for-word opener; returns null if API key not set (deterministic opener always shown in UI regardless)

**Reused existing endpoints (no new DB queries):**
- `scanner.recommendLoads({})` — fetches all drivers + scored load matches
- `dispatcher.assignLoad({ loadId, driverId })` — atomic booking transaction
- Both existed from prior sessions; no IPC handler changes required for these

**Sidebar and routing:**
- `ArrowRightLeft` icon; "Load Match" added as 2nd nav item (between Operations and Dispatcher)
- `/loadmatch` route registered in `App.tsx`

**Type declarations:**
- `global.d.ts` updated: `operations`, `profitRadar`, and `loadMatch` added to `Window.api` (these three were missing from the previous session's type update)

### Session 15 — Operations Control Panel + Profit Radar (complete)

**Operations Control Panel (new page, replaces Dashboard as default landing):**
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — merged Dashboard + new Operations content into one page
- Sections: KPI briefing strip (6 cards), Next Actions engine, Revenue Opportunities, Daily Checklist, Mini Dispatch Board, Top Leads
- Route `/operations` is now the default; `/dashboard` redirects to `/operations`
- Dashboard removed from sidebar; Operations is first nav item (Zap icon)

**Profit Radar (new feature, embedded in Operations):**
- `electron/main/profitRadar.ts` — deterministic scoring service with four opportunity types:
  - `idleDrivers` — Active drivers with no load; scored by location/equipment completeness
  - `leadHeat` — FB conversations in Call Ready / Interested / Replied / New stages; scored by stage + follow-up urgency; `nextAction` field provides deterministic recommendation per stage
  - `topGroups` — marketing_groups ranked by leads_generated_count + signed_drivers_count + priority
  - `topLanes` — aggregate RPM by origin/dest from loads table (requires >= 2 loads per lane)
- `getProfitRadarSummary()` — async function; calls Claude with concise data brief; returns 2-sentence AI summary or null if API key not configured
- IPC: `profitRadar:data` (sync) + `profitRadar:summary` (async, passes store for API key)
- Preload: `window.api.profitRadar.data()` + `.summary()`
- UI: 3-column radar grid (Idle Drivers | FB Lead Heat | Top Groups) + optional broker lanes row + AI summary strip that loads independently after main data

**Backend additions:**
- `electron/main/operations.ts` — added `loadsInTransit` count to `OperationsData`

### Session 14 -- Marketing Rebuild + FMCSA Improvements + SAFER Links + Docs Sweep + Glossary (complete)

**Marketing tab -- full daily execution system (Marketing.tsx complete rewrite):**
- Daily checklist: 5 tasks in localStorage keyed by date, auto-resets each day
- Suggested post card: anti-repetition scoring (14-day rolling window + use count), offset cycling, skip
- Variation generator: swaps opening line (OPENING_VARIANTS) and CTA (CTA_VARIANTS) for all 11 categories
- Image prompt for every post: copy-ready AI image generation prompt matched to category
- Mark as Used: creates marketing_post_log entry; LogForm captures groups, replies, leads, notes
- Post history tab: lists all logged posts from DB
- Groups tab: inline edit, truck_type_tags, active toggle, last posted display
- Template library tab: all 78 templates with use count and recency indicator
- Migration 009: marketing_post_log table + truck_type_tags, region_tags, active on marketing_groups
- marketingRepo.ts rewritten: updateMarketingGroup, listPostLog, createPostLog, updatePostLog, deletePostLog, getRecentlyUsedTemplateIds, getTemplateUsageCounts

**Bug fixes (user self-fixed in marketingUtils.ts):**
- OPENING_VARIANTS expanded from 5 to all 11 categories -- no-variant case no longer falls back silently
- isCtaLine check removed -- CTA always replaced unconditionally, fixing "variation only changes opening line"

**FMCSA SAFER hyperlinks:**
- src/lib/saferUrl.ts: builds SAFER CompanySnapshot URL for MC# and DOT# lookups
- Wired into Leads, Drivers, Brokers, Dashboard -- clicking MC# or DOT# opens SAFER in system browser

**FMCSA scraper improvements:**
- fmcsaApi.ts: pagination via start offset (3 pages x 50 = 150 per term), 200ms delay between pages
- fmcsaImport.ts: onlyNewAuthorities filter skips carriers outside 30-180 day authority age window
- DEFAULT_SEARCH_TERMS updated to 8 high-volume freight corridor states (TX, GA, IL, TN, OH, FL, IN, PA)
- AUTHORITY_MIN_DAYS and AUTHORITY_MAX_DAYS exported as constants

**Industry terms glossary (new feature):**
- src/data/industryTerms.ts: 60+ terms across 6 categories (Documents, Equipment, Regulatory, Dispatch, Rates & Freight, Business)
- Help page: added Articles / Glossary tab switcher; Glossary tab has search, category filter, alphabetical term cards

**Documentation sweep (all docs updated to current state):**
- docs/ROADMAP.md: complete rewrite -- all Phase 1+2 marked complete, Phase 3 partially done
- docs/PROJECT_MAP.md: full directory tree, IPC namespace table, key rules
- docs/FEATURE_REGISTRY.md: all 21 features documented, statuses current
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: full IPC channel table (~50 channels), full directory tree
- docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md: 15 tables, all 9 migrations described, all repo files listed
- docs/DECISIONS.md: DEC-009 through DEC-013 added
- README.md: FMCSA section updated, marketing added to features table

### Session 13 -- Document Library Expansion + Marketing Template Overhaul (complete)

**Document Library (reseedDocuments function):**
- Added `reseedDocuments(db)` to `seed.ts` — uses INSERT OR REPLACE, overwrites docs 101-108 and adds 109-120
- 20 total documents, all fully written SOPs, scripts, training guides, and reference material
- New docs 109-120: What Is Freight Dispatch (Reference), Trucking Industry Glossary (Reference), How to Find Loads — Load Board Guide (Reference), Rate Negotiation Guide (SOP), Cold Call Script (SOP), Daily Dispatch Routine (SOP), Breakdown and Emergency Procedures (SOP), How to Vet a New Broker (SOP), Explaining Your Dispatch Fee (Training), Reading a Rate Confirmation (Training), Driver Communication Standards (Policy), New Driver Pitch (SOP)
- Existing docs 101-108 expanded from short stubs to full operational depth (400-600 words each)
- IPC: `dev:reseedDocs` handler in `ipcHandlers.ts`
- Preload: `window.api.dev.reseedDocs()` added
- Settings: "Rebuild Document Library" green button added to Sample Data section with confirmation message

**Marketing Templates — complete rewrite:**
- `src/lib/postTemplates.ts` fully rewritten: 78 templates (up from 45), no emojis anywhere
- Added 5 truck-type categories: Dry Van (8), Reefer (7), Flatbed (8), Step Deck (6), Hotshot (6)
- Existing categories retained and rewritten: Driver Recruitment (10), Value Prop (8), Engagement (8), New Authority (7), Trust (5), Freight Market (5)
- All templates rewritten in natural, human conversational tone — no bullet lists with symbols, no hype
- 78 templates = ~2.5 months of unique daily posts before any repeat
- `CATEGORY_COLORS` updated with colors for all 5 new truck-type categories
- `CATEGORY_FILTER_OPTIONS` in `Marketing.tsx` updated — truck types appear first in filter bar

**Project standards:**
- No-emoji rule added to `CLAUDE.md` under "Content and Copy Rules — Never Violate"

### Session 12 -- FMCSA Auth Sort Fix + Fleet Size + Priority Calc + Invoice Delete + Marketing Tab (complete)

- Auth age sort fix in `Leads.tsx`: ascending "Auth Age" now means newest (least aged) first; special-cased `authority_date` sort to invert direction
- Fleet size: migration 007 adds `fleet_size INTEGER` to leads; SAFER scraper regex extracts Power Units; `computePriority()` uses fleet size (1-3 trucks) + authority age (30-180 days) for High/Medium/Low; `leadsRepo` CREATE and UPDATE both include `fleet_size`; `CreateLeadDto` includes fleet_size; LeadModal has Fleet Size input; LeadsTable and LeadDrawer display fleet size
- Backfill: `backfillLeadData(db)` — Phase 1 instant SQL re-prioritize all FMCSA leads, Phase 2 SAFER scrape for leads missing fleet_size (150ms delay per request); Settings "Re-enrich & Re-prioritize" button
- Invoice delete: `deleteInvoice` in `invoicesRepo.ts`; two-step confirm in `InvoiceDrawer.tsx`; `handleDelete` in `Invoices.tsx`
- Marketing tab: `src/lib/postTemplates.ts` (45 templates, 6 categories, date-seeded daily rotation); `src/pages/Marketing.tsx` (Today's Post card, category filters, prev/next, copy, Add to Tasks, Group Rotation tracker); `electron/main/repositories/marketingRepo.ts` (CRUD for marketing_groups); migration 008 adds marketing_groups table; IPC handlers and preload wired

### Session 11 -- Seed Cleanup + Sample Data Controls (complete)

- `seed.ts`: Added `seedTasksAndDocsOnly(db)` — calls internal `seedTasks` + `seedDocuments` via INSERT OR IGNORE; never touches business data tables
- `seed.ts`: Added `clearNonTaskSeedData(db)` — deletes id >= 101 from brokers, drivers, loads, leads, invoices, notes, driver_documents; leaves tasks + documents untouched
- IPC: `dev:seedTasksOnly` and `dev:clearSeedData` handlers registered in `ipcHandlers.ts`
- Preload: `window.api.dev.seedTasksOnly()` and `.clearSeedData()` exposed
- `global.d.ts`: Both methods typed
- Settings "Sample Data" section redesigned: two-card layout
  - **"Load Task Templates"** (orange) — calls `seedTasksOnly`; only seeds tasks 101-118 + docs 101-108
  - **"Remove Sample Data"** (red, with confirm dialog) — calls `clearSeedData`; strips fake business data

### Session 10 -- CSV/Paste Import + v2-Readiness + Recurring Tasks + F12 DevTools (complete)

- **CSV/Paste Lead Import**: `csvLeadImport.ts` with HEADER_MAP (including space-separated aliases), auto header-row detection (scans first 5 lines), RFC-4180 parser; IPC handlers `leads:importCsv` + `leads:importPaste`; `PasteImportModal` component; result banner in Leads page
- **v2-Readiness (Migration 005)**: Added `updated_at` to `notes` and `driver_documents` tables; extracted `getDashboardStats()` into `electron/main/dashboard.ts`; `db:query` IPC gated behind `!app.isPackaged`; `syncAdminUserFromStore()` in db.ts
- **Recurring Tasks (18 total)**: `seed.ts` expanded to tasks 101-118; tasks 111-115 are daily Marketing tasks (Facebook sweep, algorithm training, driver post sweep, response monitoring, final sweep); tasks 116-118 are weekly (Monday FMCSA review, Wednesday warm lead follow-up, Friday driver conversation review); documents 106-108 are matching SOP/reference docs
- **`isTaskForToday` fix**: Removed incorrect `if (recurring === 1) return true`; added day-of-week matching via `DOW.includes(dueDate)` check; dashboard SQL updated to match
- **F12 DevTools**: `before-input-event` listener in `index.ts` wires F12 to `toggleDevTools()`
- **`seedMissingItems(db)`**: Bypasses dev_seed_applied guard; inserts tasks 111-118 + docs 106-108 via INSERT OR IGNORE (for already-seeded databases)

### Session 9 -- Seed Data System (complete)

- `electron/main/seed.ts` (new): idempotent seed with 8 brokers, 15 drivers, 40 loads, 50 leads, 12 invoices, 10 tasks, 5 SOP documents
- Guard: checks `app_settings.dev_seed_applied = '1'` -- skips if already seeded
- IDs start at 101 to avoid collision with user-created records (autoincrement from 1)
- `runSeedIfEmpty(db)` called in `index.ts` after `initDatabase()`, wrapped in `!app.isPackaged` (dev only)
- `resetAndReseed(db)`: deletes all rows with `id >= 101`, clears guard, re-seeds
- IPC: `dev:seed` and `dev:reseed` channels registered; exposed as `window.api.dev.seed()` / `.reseed()`
- Load statuses distributed: Searching (3), Booked (5), Picked Up (5), In Transit (7), Delivered (10), Invoiced (6), Paid (4)
- RPM range 1.8--3.2 across all loads; lanes: TX-GA, IL-TX, CA-AZ, MO-CO, TX-TN, and more
- SOP documents stored as markdown using proper TypeScript `\n` escape sequences

### Session 8 -- FMCSA Manual Import Button (complete)

- Added "FMCSA Import" button to Leads toolbar (replaces disabled placeholder)
- Full IPC pipeline: renderer → preload → ipcHandlers → fmcsaImport.ts
- `electron/main/fmcsaImport.ts` (new): `FmcsaImportResult` interface + `importFmcsaLeads(db)` with dedup-by-mc_number + row-level error handling; `fetchFmcsaCandidates()` is a stub returning [] until real Safer API is wired
- IPC channel: `leads:importFmcsa` — writes `last_fmcsa_import_at` to electron-store after each run
- `FmcsaImportResult` type added to `models.ts` and `global.d.ts`
- Leads toolbar wired: `onImport`, `importBusy`, `lastImportAt` props; spinner on busy; tooltip shows last import timestamp
- Result banner in Leads page: dismissible, shows found/added/skipped/errors, amber = stub/error, green = success
- `last_fmcsa_import_at` loaded on Leads mount from electron-store, updated after each import
- Button styling matches app theme (surface-600/400 tokens, orange hover border)

### Prompt 7 -- Tasks Module + Backup Service + Scheduler + Dashboard Bug Fix (complete)

**Tasks Module:**
- Full Tasks page: Today checklist, All Tasks table, 30-day History view
- TasksToolbar: view tabs (Today/All/History), progress bar, search + category filter, Add Task button
- TaskModal: create/edit -- title, category, priority, due_date (Daily or YYYY-MM-DD), time_of_day, recurring toggle, notes
- TaskDrawer: slide-in with completion history, edit/delete, mark complete/incomplete for today
- Completion persisted by day via task_completions table (not just a status flag)
- New IPC + preload: tasks:completionsForDate

**Automation Scheduler (scaffolded, no external API calls yet):**
- electron/main/scheduler.ts -- minute-tick setInterval, no new npm packages
- Three jobs registered: fmcsa-scraper (05:00), daily-briefing (06:00), marketing-queue (Mon 07:00)
- last_run tracked per job in app_settings to prevent double-fire
- Started on app ready, stopped on window-all-closed

**Backup Service:**
- electron/main/backup.ts -- dedicated module
- Auto daily backup on launch (YYYY-MM-DD.db, skips if already exists)
- 6-hour periodic backup: YYYY-MM-DD_auto-00/06/12/18.db -- up to 5 restore points/day
- Manual backup via Settings UI (YYYY-MM-DD_manual.db)
- Staged restore: stageRestore() writes path to electron-store, applyPendingRestore() runs at next startup BEFORE DB opens -- safe, no WAL conflict
- Backup entries written to backups table (best-effort)

**Settings -- Backup & Restore UI:**
- Lists all backups from backups/ dir with filename + size
- Two-step confirm before staging restore (Restore → Confirm → stages, shows restart notice)
- Manual "Create Backup Now" button
- Google Drive Sync notes section with explicit conflict warnings

**Dashboard KPI Bug Fix:**
- "Drivers Needing a Load" was counting all Active drivers
- Fixed: NOT EXISTS correlated subquery excludes Active drivers already on Booked/Picked Up/In Transit load

### Prompt 6 -- Brokers + Invoices Modules (complete)
- Brokers: full CRUD, flag management, load history, performance metrics
- Invoices: generate from completed loads, status lifecycle, Print PDF, CSV export, email workflow

- Drivers: full profile, documents, notes, expiry alerts, min RPM
- Loads: full 7-stage lifecycle, RPM calc, dispatch fee, driver/broker assignment
- Dispatch Board: embedded in Loads page (table/board toggle)

### Prompt 4 -- Leads CRM (complete)
- Leads table + kanban, modal, drawer, lead scoring, call logs

### Foundation (complete)
- Electron + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + SQLite + IPC layer fully built
- 8 DB tables, WAL mode, daily auto-backup, all IPC channels wired

## Current App State

All pages fully operational. No PagePlaceholder stubs remaining.

**To populate a fresh database:**
1. Settings > Sample Data > "Load Task Templates" — seeds 18 tasks + 8 basic SOPs
2. Settings > Sample Data > "Rebuild Document Library" — overwrites/adds all 20 comprehensive docs
3. Settings > Sample Data > sample business data seeded automatically on first dev launch

Fully operational pages:
- Operations (default landing; KPI strip, Upcoming Check Calls, Profit Radar, Next Actions, Daily Checklist, Mini Dispatch Board, Top Leads)
- Load Match (guided dispatch workflow: driver selection, scored load matching, booking checklist, negotiation support, Book Load action)
- Active Loads (active load timeline + check call engine; per-load timeline, status updates, AI message helpers)
- Dispatcher Board (Kanban-style board with scanner recommendations)
- Leads (full CRM + FMCSA import + CSV/paste import + fleet size + backfill + SAFER links)
- Drivers (full profile + documents + SAFER links)
- Loads (full lifecycle)
- Brokers (full profile + performance + SAFER links)
- Invoices (full lifecycle + PDF/CSV/email export + delete)
- Tasks (daily checklist + all tasks + history + full CRUD; 18 seeded task templates)
- Settings (theme, business info, Backup & Restore, Google Drive notes, task templates, document library rebuild, FMCSA re-enrich)
- Documents (markdown SOP library; 20 comprehensive documents after rebuild)
- Analytics (KPIs, revenue by month/driver, lane profitability, broker volume)
- Help (articles + Glossary tab with 60+ searchable industry terms, keyboard shortcuts reference)
- Marketing (78 post templates, daily rotation, anti-repetition, variation generator, image prompts, post history logging, group manager, all 11 categories with truck types)
- FB Agents (Facebook conversation agent, lead hunter, content agent)

Global features:
- Global search overlay (Ctrl+K)
- EmptyState component
- uiStore for transient UI state
- F12 toggles DevTools

---

## Current Blockers

None. Build is clean.

---

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Start the outreach loop — the app is ready. Import FMCSA leads, start calling, work the FB pipeline
2. Add loads to the system in Searching status so Load Match has candidates to surface
3. Email/SMTP integration for invoices (replace mailto: with real send)
4. Driver document expiry push notifications (badge alerts exist, OS push does not)
5. Real deadhead estimation — Load Match currently uses a placeholder (same city = 10mi, same state = 75mi, cross-state = 250mi); a real API (PC Miler, Google Maps) would improve match quality
