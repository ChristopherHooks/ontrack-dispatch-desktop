# Session Log — OnTrack Dispatch Dashboard

## 2026-04-16 — Session 39: Find Loads Overhaul + CRM Seed Fix

### Work Completed

#### Part 1 — Find Loads: Replaced Claude-prompt UX with deterministic lane planning

Overhauled `src/pages/FindLoads.tsx`. The old `PlanningModal` (copy-commands-to-Claude workflow)
has been removed entirely. The page now has a real dispatch planning surface:

**New components added inside FindLoads.tsx:**
- `SuggestedLanesPanel` — shows 2-8 scored outbound lane suggestions for the selected driver.
  Appears automatically in the empty state. Toggled via "Search Strategy" button when results
  are loaded. Strategy tabs: All Lanes, Best Volume, Short Runs, Toward Home.
- `LaneSuggestionCard` — individual lane card. Shows origin → destination, reason tags, est.
  miles, "Fill DAT" and "Truckstop" buttons. Each button opens the load board and copies a
  structured search context (`Origin | Dest | Equip | Min RPM`) to clipboard.
- `ImportOptionsPanel` — collapsible secondary panel replacing the old "Two ways to import"
  primary card. Import instructions are now secondary to the lane suggestions.

**Controls row changes:**
- "Plan the Week" button removed.
- "Search Strategy" button added — toggles `SuggestedLanesPanel` when results are present.
  Panel is always shown in the empty state.

**New data files:**
- `src/data/freightMarkets.ts` — 35 U.S. freight markets with city/metro alias resolution.
  `resolveMarket(location)` converts any free-form city/state string to a `MarketKey`.
- `src/data/freightLanes.ts` — Static outbound lane map for all 35 markets. Each entry has
  priority (1-10), estimated miles, trip category, and reason tags.

**New service:**
- `src/services/laneSuggestionService.ts` — `getSuggestedLanes()` function. Resolves driver
  location to a market key, pulls static lane entries, applies scoring (base priority +
  toward-home bonus + historical frequency + historical avg RPM + strategy modifier), and
  returns ranked suggestions. Fully deterministic and local — no AI, no external calls.

#### Part 2 — CRM Seed Fix

**`electron/main/seed.ts`** — Removed `seedLeads(db)` call from `runSeedIfEmpty()`.
CRM now starts empty on any fresh install. Personal lead data is never pre-populated.
The `seedLeads` function still exists but is not called by any startup path.
Leads must be added via the import tools (FMCSA, CSV, manual entry).

Note: `resetAndReseed` (dev-only IPC tool) also calls `runSeedIfEmpty` and therefore
no longer seeds leads either. Dev environments also start with an empty CRM.

#### TypeScript

Zero errors across all changed files and the full project `tsc --noEmit`.

## 2026-04-16 — Session 38: Reason-Based Unassignment Tracking

### Work Completed

Unassignment reasons now recorded on every driver removal from an active load.
Only driver-fault reasons (`driver_backed_out`, `no_response_after_acceptance`) count
toward `fallout_count` and tier degradation. All other reasons are stored for audit
but have zero tier impact.

**Migration 047 — `unassignment_reason` column** (`electron/main/schema/migrations.ts`)
- `addColumnIfMissing(db, 'driver_fallout_log', 'unassignment_reason', 'TEXT')`
- NULL reason treated as fallout for backward compatibility with existing rows.

**Modified: `electron/main/repositories/driverFalloutRepo.ts`**
- `logFallout` signature: added `unassignmentReason?` and `notes?` params. Always inserts.
- All SQL queries now filter: `WHERE unassignment_reason IS NULL OR unassignment_reason IN ('driver_backed_out','no_response_after_acceptance')`
- Added `total_unassignments` and `neutral_unassignments` to `DriverFalloutStats`
- Added `FALLOUT_REASONS` Set export for reference

**Modified: `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts`**
- `loads:update` handler: extracts `unassignment_reason` from patch before DB write.
  Strips it from `cleanPatch` so it never reaches the loads table.
  Passes reason to `logFallout`.

**Modified: `src/types/models.ts`**
- Added `UNASSIGNMENT_REASONS` const array (8 entries, each with `value`, `label`, `fallout` flag)
- Added `UnassignmentReason` type
- Extended `DriverFalloutStats` with `total_unassignments` and `neutral_unassignments`
- `UpdateLoadDto` now includes `unassignment_reason?: string`

**Modified: `src/types/global.d.ts`**
- Added `DriverFalloutStats`, `DriverFalloutCountRow`, `UnassignmentReason` imports
- Added `falloutStats` and `allFalloutCounts` to `window.api.drivers` type

**Modified: `src/components/loads/constants.ts`**
- Added `UNASSIGNMENT_REASON_OPTIONS` const array (mirrors models.ts `UNASSIGNMENT_REASONS`)

**Modified: `src/components/loads/LoadsTable.tsx`** — `DriverDropdown` reason phase
- Added `phase: 'list' | 'reason'` state
- When "Unassigned" clicked with a driver assigned: shows reason sub-panel (not immediate call)
- Reason panel: back arrow, 8 reason buttons, fallout reasons labeled `(fallout)`
- On reason select: calls `onDriverChange(load, null, reason)`
- Reassign path (driverA → driverB): auto-passes `'admin_correction'`
- `onDriverChange` prop signature: `(l, driverId, reason?) => Promise<void>`

**Modified: `src/pages/Loads.tsx`**
- `handleDriverChange` gains `reason?: string` param
- Unassign path: passes `{ driver_id: null, unassignment_reason: reason }` to `loads.update`
- Reassign path: passes `unassignment_reason: reason ?? 'admin_correction'`

**Modified: `src/pages/Drivers.tsx`**
- Added `UNASSIGNMENT_REASON_OPTIONS` import from `../components/loads/constants`
- Added `pendingUnassign` state: `{ drv, status, activeLoad } | null`
- `handleStatus`: On Load → other path no longer uses `window.confirm`; sets `pendingUnassign`
- New `handleConfirmUnassign(reason)`: unassigns with reason, then updates driver status
- JSX: overlay modal with 8 reason buttons + cancel; shown when `pendingUnassign` is set

tsc --noEmit: zero errors.

## 2026-04-16 — Session 37: Driver Reliability / Fallout Tracking + Tier in Drivers Table

### Work Completed

Driver reliability metric added alongside existing acceptance rate (unchanged).
New fallout tracking system captures driver removals from active loads. Tier badge
surfaced in the main Drivers table. Fallout metrics surface in the Driver Drawer.

**Migration 046 — `driver_fallout_log` table**
- New table: `id, driver_id FK→drivers CASCADE, load_id FK→loads CASCADE,`
  `load_status_at_removal TEXT, removed_at TEXT, notes TEXT, created_at TEXT`
- Two indexes: `idx_fallout_driver`, `idx_fallout_load`
- Applies automatically on next launch

**New file: `electron/main/repositories/driverFalloutRepo.ts`**
- `logFallout(db, driverId, loadId, loadStatus)` — insert on driver removal from active load
- `getDriverFalloutStats(db, driverId)` — per-driver: `fallout_count`,
  `accepted_not_completed_count` (Picked Up / In Transit removals), `completion_rate`
- `getAllDriverFalloutCounts(db)` — batch query for all drivers (for table-level tier map)

**Modified: `electron/main/repositories/index.ts`**
- Added `export * from './driverFalloutRepo'`

**Modified: `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts`**
- Imports: `logFallout`, `getDriverFalloutStats`, `getAllDriverFalloutCounts`
- `loads:update` handler: calls `logFallout` when `driverRemoved && before.status in ['Booked','Picked Up','In Transit']`. Wrapped in try/catch — non-critical.
- New handlers: `drivers:falloutStats`, `drivers:allFalloutCounts`

**Modified: `electron/preload/index.ts`**
- Added `falloutStats(driverId)` and `allFalloutCounts()` to drivers namespace

**Modified: `src/types/models.ts`**
- Added `DriverFalloutStats` and `DriverFalloutCountRow` interfaces

**Modified: `src/types/global.d.ts`**
- Imported `DriverFalloutStats`, `DriverFalloutCountRow`
- Added `falloutStats` and `allFalloutCounts` to `window.api.drivers` type

**Modified: `src/lib/driverTierService.ts`**
- `TierInput` gains `fallout_count: number` field
- New threshold constants: `A_FALLOUT: 1`, `C_FALLOUT: 3`
- `computeDriverTier` logic: `fallout_count >= 3` → Tier C; `fallout_count <= 1` added to A conditions
- Acceptance rate logic: unchanged

**Modified: `src/pages/Reports.tsx`** — added `fallout_count: 0` to both `computeDriverTier` call sites

**Modified: `src/components/operations/MorningDispatchBrief.tsx`** — added `fallout_count: 0`

**Modified: `src/components/drivers/DriversTable.tsx`**
- Imports `DriverTierResult`, `TIER_BADGE`, `TIER_LABEL` from driverTierService
- New optional prop `tierMap?: Map<number, DriverTierResult>`
- When present: adds non-sortable `Tier` column header + badge cell per row
- Badge uses existing `TIER_BADGE` tokens; tooltip shows reason on hover

**Modified: `src/pages/Drivers.tsx`**
- New state: `tierMap: Map<number, DriverTierResult>`
- `loadTierMap()`: fetches `allWeeklyScorecards()` + `allFalloutCounts()` in parallel,
  builds map of `driver_id → DriverTierResult` (includes fallout_count per driver)
- `useEffect` now calls both `reload()` and `loadTierMap()` on mount
- `tierMap` passed to `DriversTable`

**Modified: `src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx`**
- Imports `DriverFalloutStats` type
- New state: `falloutStats: DriverFalloutStats | null`
- Fetches `window.api.drivers.falloutStats(driver.id)` alongside existing offers/scorecard
- Tier badge in header now uses real `falloutStats.fallout_count` instead of 0
- Load Behavior section: Reliability sub-block (shown when `fallout_count > 0`):
  `Fallouts` count (red >=3, yellow >=1), `Mid-Trip` (accepted_not_completed_count),
  `Completion %` rate (green >=90%, yellow >=75%, red <75%)

tsc --noEmit: zero errors.

## 2026-04-15 — Session 36: Inline Assignment + Consistency Pass

### Work Completed

Inline editing pass across Loads table and Drivers table, plus consistency
enforcement for the driver On Load → Active transition.

**src/components/loads/LoadsTable.tsx**
- New `DriverDropdown` component. Portal-positioned (same pattern as the
  existing `StatusDropdown`). Shows non-Inactive drivers + currently assigned
  driver (even if On Load). Includes `(on load)` label for secondary drivers
  so the dispatcher sees the risk. Busy state shows `…` during async call.
- `onDriverChange` optional prop added. Static driver name text replaced
  with `<DriverDropdown>`. `dMap` constant removed (no longer needed).

**src/pages/Loads.tsx**
- `handleDriverChange(load, newDriverId | null)` added.
  Three branches, all reusing existing IPC:
  1. Unassign (`null`): `loads.update(id, { driver_id: null })` → Session 35
     backend reverts load to Searching and old driver to Active.
  2. Fresh assign: `dispatcher.assignLoad` → Session 33 offer tracking fires.
  3. Reassign (`driverA → driverB`): unassign first (temporarily Searching),
     then `assignLoad` for new driver. Both loads and drivers re-fetched.
- `handleDriverChange` passed to `<LoadsTable onDriverChange={...}>`.

**src/components/drivers/DriversTable.tsx**
- New `DriverStatusDropdown` component. Same portal pattern.
  Shows all `DRIVER_STATUSES`; current status shown dimmed/disabled.
- `onStatusChange` optional prop added. Static status badge replaced with
  `<DriverStatusDropdown>`. Added `useRef`, `useEffect`, `createPortal`
  imports; added `DriverStatus` and `DRIVER_STATUSES` imports.

**src/pages/Drivers.tsx**
- `handleStatus` extended with a pre-change consistency guard:
  - Only triggers when `drv.status === 'On Load'` and target `!== 'On Load'`
  - Calls `loads.list()` and finds any Booked/Picked Up/In Transit load for
    this driver
  - Shows `window.confirm(...)` naming the specific load ref
  - On confirm: unassigns the load via `loads.update(activeLoad.id, { driver_id: null })`
    (backend reverts load to Searching; driver status update follows immediately after)
  - On cancel: early return, nothing changes
- `handleStatus` now passed as `onStatusChange` to `<DriversTable>` (previously
  was only used by `<DriverDrawer onStatusChange={handleStatus}>`).

**DriverDrawer — Location field**: confirmed already fully implemented.
`saveLocation()` → `drivers.update({ current_location })` → `onUpdate(updated)`
→ `handleUpdate` in Drivers.tsx → `setDrivers` + `setSelected`. No changes needed.

### Validation
- tsc --noEmit: zero errors
- No new IPC channels
- No schema changes
- All Session 33/34/35 fixes untouched

## 2026-04-15 — Session 35: Load Unassignment Fix

### Work Completed

Fixed the load unassignment flow so removing a driver fully reverts the
driver/load relationship across the DB and all relevant UI surfaces.

**Root causes identified:**
Three layered bugs, all introduced by `updateLoad` being a generic field-updater
with no business-logic awareness:
1. `drivers.status` not reset to `'Active'` — the load update never touched the drivers table
2. `loads.status` not reverted to `'Searching'` — the form dto included `status: 'Booked'`, which was written as-is
3. `drivers` state in Loads.tsx not refreshed after save — `handleSave` only called `setLoads`, not `setDrivers`

**electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts**
- `loads:update` handler expanded from a one-liner to a full function
- Reads existing load before update (`getLoad`)
- Detects driver removal: `before.driver_id != null && patch.driver_id === null`
- Mutates patch to include `status: 'Searching'` when status would otherwise remain `'Booked'`
- After `updateLoad`, resets old driver to `'Active'` (guarded: only if no other Booked/Picked Up/In Transit loads remain for that driver)
- The Session 33 `dispatch:assignLoad` fix (offer create+accept) is untouched

**src/pages/Loads.tsx**
- `handleSave` now detects driver removal by comparing previous load's `driver_id` to saved load's `driver_id`
- If driver was removed, calls `window.api.drivers.list().then(setDrivers)` — non-blocking, catches errors silently
- Keeps the embedded DispatchBoard and LoadDrawer's `drivers` prop in sync

### Surfaces fixed
- **Loads drawer** — Assignment section shows "Unassigned", status badge correctly reverts to "Searching", action bar no longer offers "Mark Picked Up" for an unassigned load
- **Loads board (DispatchBoard embedded in Loads.tsx)** — driver status badge returns to available after driver list refresh
- **Dispatcher Board (standalone page)** — driver correctly appears in "Needs Load" group on next load/refresh, load re-enters Available Loads panel

### Validation
- tsc --noEmit: zero errors
- No schema changes
- No new IPC channels
- `dispatch:assignLoad` offer-tracking fix untouched

## 2026-04-15 — Session 34: Driver Performance Tier System

### Work Completed

Lightweight, data-driven driver tier system (A/B/C/UNRATED) computed on the
frontend from existing scorecard fields. No schema changes, no new IPC.

**src/lib/driverTierService.ts (new)**
- `computeDriverTier(TierInput): DriverTierResult` — pure function.
- UNRATED: insufficient data (< 3 resolved offers AND < 2 loads booked).
- C: any single trigger — acceptance < 40%, no_response >= 3, avg_response > 120 min.
- A: all conditions — acceptance >= 70%, avg_response <= 60 min, no_response <= 1,
  loads >= 2.
- B: has data, not A or C.
- Exports: `TIER_BADGE` (Tailwind token classes), `TIER_LABEL`, `tierSortRank()`.

**src/types/models.ts**
- Re-exports `DriverTier`, `DriverTierResult`, `TierInput` from driverTierService.
- `MorningDispatchBriefRow` extended with 4 fields: `accepted_count`, `declined_count`,
  `no_response_count`, `loads_booked` (all `number`).

**electron/main/morningDispatchBrief.ts**
- Passes 4 new fields from scorecard map into each row. Zero-default when missing.

**src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx**
- Import added. Tier badge rendered in header (beside status badge) when `weeklyCard`
  is available. Computed inline via IIFE to keep JSX clean.

**src/components/operations/MorningDispatchBrief.tsx**
- Import added. `driverTierResult` computed per DriverCard. Badge rendered beside
  driver name. Separate name avoids collision with existing `tier` (load score).

**src/pages/Reports.tsx**
- Import added. `ScoreSort` extended with `'tier'`. Sort logic special-cases tier
  using `tierSortRank()` instead of direct field access. New "Tier" column (last).
  Badge shows reason on hover via HTML `title` attribute.

### Validation
- tsc --noEmit: zero errors
- No schema changes
- No new IPC channels
- No existing functionality broken

## 2026-04-15 — Session 33: Dynamic Daily Workflow System

### Work Completed

Replaced the static Morning Briefing checklist on the Operations page with a
conditional, profit-first Daily Workflow panel. All changes additive — no schema
changes, no new IPC channels beyond a single count field.

**src/lib/dailyWorkflowEngine.ts (new)**
- Pure function `computeDailyWorkflow(input, manuallyDone)` → `DailyWorkflowTask[]`.
- 11 tasks across 4 tiers: revenue_now, revenue_protection, pipeline, admin.
- Each task is either `actionable` (count > 0), `not_applicable` (auto-skipped with
  a reason string), or `completed` (manually toggled by the dispatcher).
- Profit-first ordering: book loads → check calls → invoice → AR → compliance →
  lead follow-up → driver prospects → warm leads → stale cleanup → marketing.
- Tasks that have no underlying data skip automatically. No checklist theater.

**src/components/operations/DailyWorkflowPanel.tsx (new)**
- Renders task groups by category with tier labels (Revenue Now, Revenue Protection,
  Pipeline, Admin).
- Actionable tasks: bold title, orange count badge, always-visible action button,
  manual mark-done checkbox.
- Not-applicable tasks: compact gray row with reason text — visible but non-intrusive.
- Completed tasks: green checkmark, strikethrough title, click to undo.
- Scroll action support: `#scroll:morning-dispatch-brief` scrolls to the
  MorningDispatchBrief section without page navigation.

**electron/main/operations.ts**
- Added `overdueInvoices: number` count (invoices WHERE status = 'Overdue').
- Added to `OperationsData` interface and return object.

**src/types/models.ts**
- Added `overdueInvoices: number` to `OperationsData` interface.

**src/pages/Operations.tsx**
- Removed static Morning Briefing (6-row checklist) — superseded by Daily Workflow.
- Added `workflowDone: Set<string>` state for per-session manual completions.
- Computed `overdueCheckCalls` from existing `checkCalls` state.
- Calls `computeDailyWorkflow()` with all current operational data + manuallyDone set.
- Wrapped `<MorningDispatchBrief>` in `<div id='morning-dispatch-brief'>` for scroll target.
- Added imports: DailyWorkflowPanel, computeDailyWorkflow, DailyWorkflowTask.
- Removed unused lucide-react imports (CheckCircle2, Circle, Receipt).
- EMPTY constant updated with `overdueInvoices: 0`.

### No-change list
- No new IPC channels, no preload changes.
- No schema migrations.
- No changes to MorningDispatchBrief, Profit Radar, KPI strip, or any other page.
- tsc --noEmit passes with zero errors.

---

## 2026-04-15 — Session 32: Morning Dispatch Brief

### Work Completed

Additive feature: Morning Dispatch Brief section on the Operations page.
No schema changes. No rewrites of existing systems. All additive.

**electron/main/morningDispatchBrief.ts (new)**
- `getMorningDispatchBrief(db)`: assembles driver-first morning planning data.
  Uses `getRecommendations` (loadScanner, unchanged) for eligible drivers + top 5 loads.
  Trims to top 3 per driver. Enriches with current_location + min_rpm via a direct
  driver query, and acceptance_rate / avg_response_minutes / dispatcher_revenue via
  `getAllDriversWeeklyScorecards` (driverPerformanceRepo, unchanged).
  Sort: has suggestions first -> best top score desc -> no-suggestion rows last.

**src/types/models.ts**
- Added `MorningDispatchBriefRow` interface with driver context fields and suggestions array.

**electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts**
- Added `operations:morningBrief` handler.

**electron/preload/index.ts**
- Added `morningBrief()` to the `operations` namespace.

**src/types/global.d.ts**
- Imported `MorningDispatchBriefRow`.
- Added `morningBrief: () => Promise<MorningDispatchBriefRow[]>` to operations API type.

**src/components/operations/MorningDispatchBrief.tsx (new)**
- Section header with driver count.
- DriverCard per eligible driver: name, location, min RPM, acceptance rate,
  avg response time, weekly dispatcher revenue.
- SuggestionRow per top-3 load: score indicator, lane (origin -> dest), RPM,
  deadhead (orange if > 200 mi), gross rate, broker, pickup date, Assign button.
- Assign calls `window.api.dispatcher.assignLoad({ loadId, driverId })` and marks
  row as assigned on success. Refresh callback fires to re-pull the brief.
- Empty states for: no eligible drivers, eligible driver but no suggestions.

**src/pages/Operations.tsx**
- Added `morningBrief` and `briefLoading` state.
- Added `refreshMorningBrief` helper.
- Fetch fires independently (does not block main data render).
- `MorningDispatchBrief` component rendered between Morning Briefing checklist and KPI strip.

**Session 32 addendum — load_offers integration patch:**

`MorningDispatchBrief.tsx` SuggestionRow updated to mirror the canonical Loads.tsx
offer workflow:
- `useEffect` on mount calls `loadOffers.create(driverId, loadId)` (find-or-create —
  safe against re-render/reopen) and stores `offerId` in local state.
- `handleAssign` now calls `loadOffers.updateStatus(offerId, 'accepted')` after a
  successful `dispatcher.assignLoad`. Matches Loads.tsx handleAssign exactly.
- `handleSkip` added: calls `loadOffers.updateStatus(offerId, 'declined')` and hides
  the row. X button added alongside Assign.
- `X` icon imported from lucide-react. `LoadOffer` type imported from models.
- `useEffect` added to React imports.
- No new IPC channels, no schema changes, no repo changes.

---

## 2026-04-15 — Session 31: Per-Driver Weekly Scorecard System

### Work Completed

Additive feature: Per-Driver Weekly Scorecard. No schema changes. No existing
behavior altered.

**driverPerformanceRepo.ts (new)**
- `getDriverWeeklyScorecard(db, driverId)`: returns scorecard for a single driver
  covering the current Mon–Sun window. Includes revenue metrics (loads_booked,
  gross_revenue, dispatcher_revenue, avg_rpm), offer behavior stats (accepted,
  declined, no_response, open, acceptance_rate, avg_response_minutes), and
  trend vs prior week (revenue_trend_pct, loads_trend_delta).
- `getAllDriversWeeklyScorecards(db)`: single-query join across all non-Inactive
  drivers. Returns rows sorted by dispatcher_revenue DESC, loads_booked DESC.
  No trend data (all-drivers endpoint).
- Week bounds computed in JS (getWeekBounds helper). Offer stats use the same
  hardened acceptance_rate logic as getDriverAcceptanceStats (resolved-only
  denominator, NULLIF guard).

**repositories/index.ts**
- Added export for driverPerformanceRepo.

**src/types/models.ts**
- Added DriverWeeklyScorecard interface.

**electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts**
- Added `drivers:weeklyScorecard` and `drivers:allWeeklyScorecards` handlers.

**electron/preload/index.ts**
- Added `weeklyScorecard(driverId)` and `allWeeklyScorecards()` to drivers namespace.

**src/types/global.d.ts**
- Imported DriverWeeklyScorecard.
- Added method signatures to drivers API type block.

**src/pages/Reports.tsx**
- Added "Driver Performance — This Week" section after KPI strip.
- Table: Driver, Loads, Gross, Disp. Cut, Avg RPM, Acc. Rate, Avg Resp,
  Acc/Dec/NR breakdown, Open Offers.
- Client-side sort on Loads, Disp. Cut, Avg RPM, Acc. Rate. Click header to toggle
  direction. Default: Disp. Cut descending.
- Uses existing badge/token system.

**src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx**
- Added `weeklyCard` state and fetch in useEffect.
- Added "This Week" compact panel after Current Load, before Carrier Setup.
- Shows: loads, gross, dispatcher cut + % trend vs last week, avg RPM, acceptance
  rate, avg response time. All conditionally rendered — section hidden if null.

## 2026-04-15 — Session 30: Load Offer Tracking — Data Integrity Hardening

### Work Completed

Data integrity pass on the Load Offer Tracking System (Session 29). No redesign —
all changes are additive or narrowly targeted at the three root causes: duplicate
open offers, inaccurate acceptance_rate denominator, and no manual no_response path.

**loadOffersRepo.ts — find-or-create guard**
- `createOffer` now checks for an existing open offer (outcome IS NULL) for the same
  (driver_id, load_id) before inserting. Returns the existing row if found.
  This prevents duplicate open offers from panel reopen / React rerender without
  blocking new offers when a previously-declined load is shown again.

**loadOffersRepo.ts — mark functions hardened**
- `markAccepted`, `markDeclined`, `markNoResponse` each add `AND outcome IS NULL`
  to the WHERE clause. Resolved offers cannot be overwritten by a stale IPC call.

**loadOffersRepo.ts — getDriverAcceptanceStats**
- Added `open_offer_count` (SUM where outcome IS NULL)
- `acceptance_rate` denominator changed from COUNT(*) to resolved-only count
  (accepted + declined + no_response). NULLIF(resolved_count, 0) guards divide-by-zero.
  When resolved_count = 0 (all open), rate coerces to 0 — never NULL in the return struct.

**loadOffersRepo.ts — sweepNoResponse**
- Added explicit comments explaining the three-layer safety (outcome IS NULL,
  responded_at IS NULL, julianday arithmetic) so the intent is clear to future editors.

**src/types/models.ts**
- `LoadOfferStats`: added `open_offer_count: number` field with JSDoc explaining
  resolved-only rate semantics.

**src/pages/Loads.tsx — DispatchBoard**
- Added `loadingOffers` boolean state; `openOfferPanel` sets it true before the
  async fetch and false in `finally`, preventing double-fire from rapid button clicks.
- Added `handleMarkNoResponse(al)`: calls `updateStatus(offerId, 'no_response')` and
  dismisses the row — manual override without waiting for the 2-hour sweep.
- Added "N/R" (No Response) button per offer row in the panel (Clock icon).
- "Find Load" button disabled and shows "Loading..." while `loadingOffers` is true.

**src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx — Load Behavior**
- Breakdown row now shows `open_offer_count` in orange when > 0.
- Acceptance Rate label appends "(excl. open)" when open offers exist, so the
  dispatcher understands why the displayed rate may not sum to 100%.

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/repositories/loadOffersRepo.ts` — find-or-create, hardened marks, stats
- `src/types/models.ts` — open_offer_count in LoadOfferStats
- `src/pages/Loads.tsx` — loadingOffers guard, handleMarkNoResponse, N/R button
- `src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx` — open_offer_count display
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — this entry
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — updated

---

## 2026-04-15 — Session 29: Load Offer Tracking System

### Work Completed

Full Load Offer Tracking System implemented across DB, repository, IPC, and UI layers.
Every load offered to every driver is now recorded with outcome (accepted / declined / no_response)
and decline reason. DispatchBoard gains a "Find Load" inline panel; DriverDrawer gains a
Load Behavior stats section.

**Migration 045**
- `load_offers` table: id, driver_id (FK), load_id (FK), offered_at, responded_at, outcome CHECK,
  decline_reason, created_at, updated_at
- Indexes on driver_id, load_id, outcome

**loadOffersRepo.ts (new)**
- `createOffer(db, driverId, loadId)` — inserts pending offer
- `markAccepted(db, offerId)` — sets outcome + responded_at
- `markDeclined(db, offerId, reason?)` — sets outcome + reason + responded_at
- `markNoResponse(db, offerId)` — sets outcome + responded_at
- `getOffersByDriver(db, driverId)` — all offers newest first
- `getDriverAcceptanceStats(db, driverId)` — total, accepted, declined, no_response, acceptance_rate, avg_response_minutes
- `sweepNoResponse(db)` — bulk UPDATE for offers 2+ hours old with no outcome

**IPC + Preload + Types**
- 3 new handlers: `loadOffers:create`, `loadOffers:updateStatus`, `loadOffers:getDriverStats`
- Preload: `window.api.loadOffers` namespace
- `models.ts`: `LoadOffer`, `LoadOfferStats`, `LoadOfferOutcome`, `LOAD_OFFER_DECLINE_REASONS`
- `global.d.ts`: full TypeScript declarations

**DispatchBoard (Loads.tsx)**
- "Find Load" button on Needs Load driver cards
- Fetches available loads + creates offer records for each load shown
- Assign button: calls `dispatcher.assignLoad` + `loadOffers.updateStatus('accepted')`
- Skip button: opens decline reason dropdown; calls `loadOffers.updateStatus('declined', reason)`
- Decline reasons: Rate too low, Too far, Bad lane, Driver unavailable, Other

**DriverDrawer.tsx**
- New "Load Behavior" section (hidden when total_offers = 0)
- Shows: acceptance rate %, total offers, avg response time, breakdown (accepted / declined / no response)

## 2026-04-15 — Session 28: Outreach Engine — DB wiring, performance panel, dashboard reminder, bug fix

### Work Completed

Completed the full Outreach Engine integration. Session 27 built the generation
core; Session 28 replaced the localStorage refresh tracking with a proper
DB-backed system, added performance visibility into the Post History tab, added
a dashboard reminder banner, wrote the implementation spec, and fixed a runtime
crash that prevented the Marketing tab from loading.

**1 — Migration 039**
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` — new `outreach_refresh_log` table
  (id, refreshed_at, notes, template_count_added); migration added to MIGRATIONS array

**2 — outreachRepo.ts (new)**
- `getLastRefresh(db)` — latest refresh row or null
- `logRefresh(db, notes, templateCountAdded)` — insert refresh record
- `getOutreachPerformance(db)` — aggregates marketing_post_log by template_id; score = replies + leads*3
- `getOutreachSummary(db)` — total posts/replies/leads, top template, stale template list (8+ uses, score=0)

**3 — IPC wiring**
- `repositories/index.ts` — re-export added
- `ipcHandlers.ts` — 4 new handlers: outreach:getLastRefresh, outreach:logRefresh, outreach:performance, outreach:summary
- `preload/index.ts` — outreach namespace with 4 methods
- `global.d.ts` — full TypeScript types for window.api.outreach

**4 — Marketing.tsx (modified)**
- Replaced localStorage refresh state with DB-backed `loadOutreachMeta()` fetching getLastRefresh + performance + summary on mount
- "Mark refresh done" button writes to DB via outreach.logRefresh and reloads meta
- `OutreachPerformancePanel` wired into Post History tab (shown when total_posts > 0)
- Added missing `import OutreachPerformancePanel` statement — this was the bug causing "OutreachPerformancePanel is not defined" crash on Marketing tab load

**5 — OutreachPerformancePanel.tsx (new)**
- Location: `src/components/marketing/OutreachPerformancePanel.tsx`
- Stat tiles, top-5 template table with score coloring, stale warning block, bottom-3 table

**6 — Dashboard.tsx (modified)**
- Fetches outreach.getLastRefresh() on mount
- Blue dismissible banner when no refresh logged or last refresh >= 7 days ago
- "Go to Outreach" button navigates to /marketing

**7 — docs/OUTREACH_ENGINE_SPEC.md (new)**
- Full implementation reference covering all 9 sections: architecture, schema,
  generation logic, humanization, UI integration, weekly refresh, files/functions
  reference, output format, build order

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` (modified)
- `electron/main/repositories/outreachRepo.ts` (new)
- `electron/main/repositories/index.ts` (modified)
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` (modified)
- `electron/preload/index.ts` (modified)
- `src/types/global.d.ts` (modified)

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` (updated)
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` (updated)

## 2026-04-14 — Session 27: Outreach Engine

### Work Completed

Built the Outreach Engine — a zero-AI-cost daily Facebook outreach system that generates 5 group posts + 1 page post in one click.

**1 — outreachEngine.ts (new)**
- Hook bank: 20 hooks, 2 natural-sounding variations each (40 total opening lines)
- CTA bank: 15 CTAs, 2 variations each (30 closers)
- Pain point bank: 15 entries — specific, concrete, written in dispatcher voice
- Benefit bank: 15 entries — phrased as first-person "I do X" statements
- Template library: 20 variable-based outreach templates using `{driver_type}`, `{lane_region}`, `{rpm_range}`, `{company_name}`, `{pain_point}`, `{benefit}`; tagged by driver type for relevance filtering
- 5 page post templates — distinct from group posts, slightly more structured
- `generateTodaysOutreach()`: seeded PRNG (LCG, deterministic by date + offset) so same-day picks are stable; scores templates by recency + driver type match; picks 5 unique templates, hooks, CTAs, pain points, benefits; assembles and fills all variables
- Humanization: word-swap dictionary (14 swap pairs, 28% application rate) — alternates "DM me"/"message me", "right now"/"at the moment", "broker contacts"/"broker relationships", etc.
- `getWeeklyRefreshState()` / `markAiRefreshDone()`: localStorage-backed weekly AI refresh reminder (triggers after 7 days)
- `computeTemplateScores()`: ranks templates by post log replies + leads for performance-weighted selection
- `groupSuccessScore()`: derives group performance from leads_generated_count + signed_drivers_count

**2 — Marketing.tsx (modified)**
- Added `Zap` and `AlertTriangle` to lucide imports
- Imported `generateTodaysOutreach`, `getWeeklyRefreshState`, `markAiRefreshDone`, and related types
- Extended `activeTab` type to include `'outreach'`
- Added 7 new state variables: `outreachResult`, `outreachSeed`, `outreachCopied`, `outreachDriverType`, `outreachLaneRegion`, `outreachRpmRange`, `refreshState`
- Added 4th tab "Outreach Engine" (Zap icon) to existing tab bar
- New Outreach Engine tab panel: driver type dropdown, lane region input, RPM range input, Generate + Regenerate buttons, 5 group post cards, 1 page post card, weekly refresh reminder banner, weekly AI usage plan checklist
- `OutreachPostCard` component: per-post Copy + Mark Used actions; Mark Used logs to marketing_post_log via existing IPC so anti-repetition engine learns over time; local `markedUsed` state shows "Logged" confirmation

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/outreachEngine.ts` (new, 717 lines)
- `src/pages/Marketing.tsx` (modified, +289 lines, now 1549 lines)

### No migrations, no new IPC, no changes outside Marketing module

## 2026-03-29 — Session 26: Eight Further App Improvements

### Work Completed

Eight improvements across driver ops, invoicing, broker management, reporting, and lead tracking.

**1 — Driver Run Sheet PDF (LoadDrawer)**

- "Run Sheet" button visible in action bar only for Booked / Picked Up / In Transit loads

**2 — Invoice Aging Table (Reports)**
- `reports.ts` — `InvoiceAgingRow` interface + query: joins invoices → loads → brokers, WHERE status IN ('Sent','Overdue'), computes `days_out` via `julianday()`, buckets: 0-15 / 16-30 / 31-60 / 60+; ORDER BY days_out DESC
- `ReportsData` updated to include `invoiceAging`
- `Reports.tsx` — "Accounts Receivable Aging" section: 4-bucket summary tiles + line-by-line detail table (before IFTA)

**4 — Driver Document Expiry Alert on Dashboard**
- `global.d.ts` — `compliance: () => Promise<DriverComplianceRow[]>` added to drivers type; `DriverComplianceRow` import added
- `Dashboard.tsx` — on mount, calls `window.api.drivers.compliance()`; flattens cdl_expiry / insurance_expiry / medical_card_expiry / coi_expiry into individual `ExpiryAlert` entries; filters for 0–30 days; dismissible amber banner above Weekly Revenue Target

**5 — Monthly Revenue Pacing Enhancement (Operations)**
- `Operations.tsx` — added `projected = (revenue / dayOfMo) * daysInMo` calculation; `onPace` uses projected vs goal; added "Projected Month End" stat (green/orange) and "Day X of Y / N days left" combined stat

**6 — Lane Performance Table (Reports)**
- `reports.ts` — `LanePerformanceRow` interface + query: groups completed loads by origin_state / dest_state; `avg_rpm` weighted average (CASE WHEN miles > 0), `best_rpm` (MAX), `total_fee`; ORDER BY avg_rpm DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 30
- `ReportsData` updated to include `lanePerformance`
- `Reports.tsx` — "Lane Performance" section with RPM color coding (before IFTA)

**7 — Dispatcher Net Summary in LoadDrawer Financials**
- `LoadDrawer.tsx` — summary sub-block after financials grid: Your Earnings (dispatch fee) / Driver Net (gross minus dispatch fee minus all deductions); uses already-loaded `deductions` state — no extra IPC

**8 — Leads Last-Contact Aging Column**
- `LeadsTable.tsx` — `daysSinceContact()` helper (uses `last_contact_date`); `contactAgeCls()` helper (red >= 21d, yellow >= 14d, neutral for terminal statuses); "Last Contact" column added after Follow-Up; displays "today" or "Nd ago" with tooltip

- `offResult` listener leak in preload (browserImport group) — non-blocking, carried from Session 21
- Next migration will be 032

---

## 2026-03-29 — Session 25: Eight More App Improvements

### Work Completed

Eight improvements across load management, invoicing, settlements, broker intelligence, and tooling.

**1 — Check Call Log in LoadDrawer**

- Fuel price in Rate Calculator pre-fills from `fuelPricePerGallon` setting; also editable inline per session

---

## 2026-03-28 — Session 24: Route Fix + Docs and Task Update

### Work Completed

**1 — Morning Briefing "Find Loads" blank screen fix**
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — corrected two route path mismatches in the Morning Briefing `rows` array:
  - `'/find-loads'` changed to `'/findloads'`
  - `'/active-loads'` changed to `'/activeloads'`
- Root cause: React Router found no matching route for the hyphenated paths and silently rendered nothing. All other navigation (Sidebar, OnboardingWizard) already used the correct un-hyphenated paths; the Morning Briefing was the only callsite out of sync.

**2 — Saturday task added to seed (ID 133)**
- `electron/main/seed.ts` — added Saturday-specific daily task for weekend revenue push (load booking + lead follow-up + Facebook posting), with explicit `day_of_week: 'Saturday'` recurrence and actionable notes

**3 — Daily Operations Playbook SOP updated (ID 125)**
- `electron/main/seed.ts` — rewrote the Daily Operations Playbook content to be revenue-first, with a clear priority order: loads before leads before marketing, plus an end-of-month urgency protocol

**4 — HANDOFF.md and SESSION_LOG.md updated**

### Files Changed
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — route path fix (2 lines)
- `electron/main/seed.ts` — Saturday task (ID 133), updated Daily Operations Playbook (ID 125)
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — updated
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — this file

### TypeScript
No structural changes. The Operations.tsx edit is a string value correction only — no type changes.

### Notes for Next Session
- Run `tsc --noEmit` to verify zero errors (not run this session)
- Chris should go to Settings > Reseed Documents to pick up the updated Daily Operations Playbook and new Saturday task in the app
- `offResult` IPC listener leak in `electron/preload/index.ts` carried forward from Session 21 — non-blocking

---

## 2026-03-28 — Session 23: Eight App Improvements

### Work Completed

Eight improvements implemented across invoicing, load management, driver pay history, morning briefing, reporting, and document attachments.

**1 — Auto-flag Overdue Invoices on Startup**
- `invoicesRepo.ts` — `autoFlagOverdueInvoices(db)` flips Sent invoices to Overdue when days since sent_date exceeds broker payment_terms (correlated subquery, default 30d)
- IPC handler `invoices:autoFlag`; preload + global.d.ts wired; called silently in `App.tsx` startup useEffect

**2 — Duplicate Load Button**
- `LoadDrawer.tsx` — `onDuplicate` prop + Copy button in action bar
- `Loads.tsx` — `handleDuplicate()` pre-fills modal with route/broker/driver/trailer/commodity, clears rate/dates, forces status to 'Searching'

**3 — Driver Pay History in DriverDrawer**
- `DriverDrawer.tsx` — last 20 Paid invoices for the driver shown in a Pay History section (invoice number, paid date, dispatch fee, driver gross)

**4 — Stale Load Nudges in Morning Briefing**
- `operations.ts` — SQL finds Booked loads past pickup date and Picked Up/In Transit loads past delivery date
- `models.ts` — `staleLoads` added to `OperationsData`
- `Operations.tsx` — sixth BriefRow with load IDs, status, days past; links to /loads

**5 + 8 — Reports Page (Weekly P&L, Monthly P&L, Broker Performance, IFTA)**
- `electron/main/reports.ts` (new) — `getReportsData(db)` returns 12-week revenue, 6-month revenue, top-20 broker table, per-state mileage, all-time and YTD totals
- `src/pages/Reports.tsx` (new) — KPI strip, horizontal bar charts, broker table, IFTA state grid; types inlined to avoid cross-bundle import
- `Sidebar.tsx` — Reports nav item added; `App.tsx` — `/reports` route added

**6 — Load Calendar View**
- `LoadsToolbar.tsx` — `LoadView` type exported; Calendar button added; "Dispatch Board" → "Dispatch"
- `Loads.tsx` — weekly `LoadCalendar` inline component; blue = pickup, green = delivery; prev/next week nav

**7 — Load Document Attachments**
- Migration 028: `load_attachments` table with FK to loads (CASCADE)
- `loadAttachmentsRepo.ts` (new) — list/create/delete helpers
- IPC handlers for list/create/delete/open/pick; pick uses `dialog.showOpenDialog` + `copyFileSync` to `userData/load-attachments/{loadId}/`
- `LoadDrawer.tsx` — Attachments section with file picker, title input, open/delete per file

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/repositories/invoicesRepo.ts` — `autoFlagOverdueInvoices`
- `electron/main/repositories/loadAttachmentsRepo.ts` (new)
- `electron/main/repositories/index.ts` — loadAttachmentsRepo export
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` — migration 028

- `src/types/models.ts` — staleLoads on OperationsData
- `src/App.tsx` — autoFlag startup call, Reports import + route
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — sixth BriefRow (stale loads)
- `src/pages/Reports.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/Loads.tsx` — handleDuplicate, LoadView state, LoadCalendar component
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Reports nav item
- `src/components/loads/LoadsToolbar.tsx` — LoadView type, Calendar button
- `src/components/loads/LoadDrawer.tsx` — Duplicate button, Attachments section
- `src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx` — Pay History section

### Notes for Next Session
- Run `tsc --noEmit` to verify zero TypeScript errors — not run this session
- `offResult` listener leak in `electron/preload/index.ts` (browserImport group) — carried over from Session 21, non-blocking
- IFTA mileage uses destination state as approximation — clearly labeled in UI; GPS per-state tracking not available

---

## 2026-03-28 — Session 22: Six App Improvements

### Work Completed

Six improvements implemented across compliance tracking, revenue, load intelligence, and invoicing.

**1 — Driver Medical Card Expiry (migration 027)**
- Migration 027 adds `medical_card_expiry TEXT` to `drivers` via `addColumnIfMissing()`
- `Driver` + `DriverComplianceRow` interfaces updated
- `driversRepo.ts` — field included in create, update, and getDriverCompliance
- `operations.ts` — Medical Card added to `expiringDocs` UNION ALL (60-day lookahead, Active drivers only)
- `DriverModal.tsx` — Medical Card Expiry date field added
- `DriverDrawer.tsx` — display row with orange warning when expiring

**2 — Morning Briefing Compliance Row**
- `Operations.tsx` — fifth BriefRow shows compliance doc status; links to /drivers

**3 — Smart Rate Floor / Broker Avg RPM on Find Loads**
- `FindLoads.tsx` — parallel fetch of brokers + loads; `buildBrokerIntel()` derives name-keyed Map
- `BrokerIntelBadge` displays avg RPM, load count, flag on load cards
- No backend changes; pure frontend computation

**4 — Rate Confirmation PDF**
- `LoadDrawer.tsx` — `printRateConfirmation()` — letterhead, route, parties, gross rate, dispatch fee
- Shown for Booked/Picked Up/In Transit loads

**5 — Driver Settlement Statement PDF**
- `LoadDrawer.tsx` — `printSettlement()` — gross rate minus fee = driver net, signature line
- Shown for Delivered/Invoiced/Paid loads

**6 — Invoice Follow-Up Email Template**
- `InvoiceDrawer.tsx` — `followUpMode` state; `daysOverdue` from sent date minus broker payment_terms (default 30)
- Assertive follow-up body with days overdue, amounts, and clear payment request
- "Follow-up (Nd)" button in action bar for Sent/Overdue invoices
- Invoice/Follow-up tabs in email panel; `activeSubject`/`activeBody` drive the mailto href

**Discovered already built — no changes needed:**
- Weekly revenue goal (`Operations.tsx`)
- Invoice aging display (`InvoicesTable.tsx` — `effectiveStatus()` + `agingLabel()`)

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` — migration 027
- `src/types/models.ts` — `medical_card_expiry` on Driver + DriverComplianceRow
- `electron/main/repositories/driversRepo.ts` — create/update/getDriverCompliance
- `electron/main/operations.ts` — expiringDocs Medical Card UNION branch
- `src/components/drivers/DriverModal.tsx` — Medical Card Expiry field
- `src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx` — Medical Card Expiry display
- `src/components/drivers/DriversTable.tsx` — Med. Card column
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — compliance BriefRow

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — updated
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — updated

### TypeScript
Not re-verified this session (no tsc run available). Changes follow established patterns; no new dependencies or structural changes introduced.

### Pending
None. All six items complete.

## 2026-03-27 — Session 21: Browser Import IPC Fix

### Work Completed

Fixed the browser import delivery path so data POSTed by Claude in Chrome to `localhost:3001` reliably reaches the Find Loads renderer. Live end-to-end test passed: POST returned `{ok:true, count:1}`, result appeared in Find Loads within 2 seconds.

**Root cause:** Electron renderer's `fetch()` to `http://localhost:3001` silently fails (CSP / cross-origin). `webContents.send` IPC push also not reaching renderer (cause unknown without DevTools access). Both failure modes bypass the `catch` block, so there was no visible error.

**Fix:** Added `loads:getLastBrowserImport` IPC invoke channel. Renderer polls via `window.api.loads.getLastBrowserImport()` every 2 seconds using the same invoke path used by all other `window.api.*` calls. Seq-based deduplication (`lastSeqRef`) prevents re-rendering on unchanged data.

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/webServer.ts` — exported `getLastBrowserImport(): { seq, payload }`
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` — imported and registered `ipcMain.handle('loads:getLastBrowserImport', ...)`
- `electron/preload/index.ts` — exposed `getLastBrowserImport` under `loads` contextBridge group
- `src/types/global.d.ts` — typed `window.api.loads.getLastBrowserImport`
- `src/pages/FindLoads.tsx` — replaced `fetch()` poll with `window.api.loads.getLastBrowserImport()` poll
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — updated
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — updated

### TypeScript
`tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors after all changes.

### Known Issues Carried Forward
- `offResult` in `preload/index.ts` creates a new anonymous function wrapper on each call, so `ipcRenderer.removeListener` never fires. The `loads:browser-import` push listener leaks on page unmount. Non-blocking — polling is the active mechanism.

---

## 2026-03-16 — Session 20: Audit Fixes Continued

### Work Completed

Completed the remaining audit fixes from the Session 18 comprehensive audit. All changes pass `tsc --noEmit` with zero errors. 18 migrations total (017 + 018 added this session).

**CAT-A — Audit log writes (all 5 entity repos):**
- `logAudit()` calls added to create/update/delete in: `loadsRepo.ts`, `invoicesRepo.ts`, `brokersRepo.ts`, `driversRepo.ts`, `leadsRepo.ts`
- `deleteLoad()` now guards against deleting a load with status Booked/Picked Up/In Transit (throws `Error` with message explaining why)
- All delete functions now fetch the existing row first to capture old values for the audit entry
- User ID hardcoded to 1 (single admin user) — appropriate for local single-user app

**H-8 + migrations 017/018:**
- Migration 017: `broker_id INTEGER REFERENCES brokers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` added to `invoices` table
- Migration 018: `trailer_type TEXT` added to `loads` table
- Both use the existing `addColumnIfMissing()` helper — safe to run on databases with existing data

**H-3 — BrokerDrawer production fix + scoring deduplication:**
- Root cause: `BrokerDrawer.tsx` was calling `window.api.db.query()` which is gated behind `!app.isPackaged` in the main process — silently returns nothing in packaged/production builds
- Fix: replaced with `window.api.loads.list()` filtered client-side by `broker_id`
- Added `window.api.intel.allBrokers()` to the `useEffect` Promise.all; broker's rating now comes directly from the intelligence service instead of a duplicated inline IIFE
- Removed ~15-line IIFE that replicated exact scoring logic from `brokerIntelligence.ts`
- `INTEL_RATING_STYLE` moved to module level and typed as `Record<BrokerRating, string>`

**M-8 — Shared interfaces exported from models.ts:**
- `OperationsData`, `DriverOpportunity`, `LeadHeat`, `GroupPerformance`, `BrokerLane`, `ProfitRadarData` added to `src/types/models.ts`
- `Operations.tsx` updated to import them — local copies removed; `ScoredLead` and `NextAction` stay local as they are page-specific

**M-9 — Content-Security-Policy header:**
- `electron/main/index.ts`: `session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived` injects a CSP header — gated behind `app.isPackaged` so it does not run in dev mode (Vite HMR uses inline scripts + WebSocket which strict CSP blocks)
- Policy: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'`
- `'unsafe-inline'` required for `style-src` due to Tailwind CSS utility classes

### Files Changed
- `electron/main/repositories/loadsRepo.ts`
- `electron/main/repositories/invoicesRepo.ts`
- `electron/main/repositories/brokersRepo.ts`
- `electron/main/repositories/driversRepo.ts`
- `electron/main/repositories/leadsRepo.ts`
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` (migrations 017, 018)
- `electron/main/index.ts` (CSP + session import)
- `src/components/brokers/BrokerDrawer.tsx`
- `src/types/models.ts`
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx`

### Skipped / Deferred
- M-7: auto-update `marketing_groups.last_posted_at` on post log create — requires reading Marketing.tsx post-save flow; deferred
- M-1: split `ipcHandlers.ts` into domain files — too large a structural refactor for this session
- H-1: `sandbox: false` → `sandbox: true` — intentionally deferred; preload uses `contextBridge` + `ipcRenderer` only but was flagged as risky without test coverage
- L-1/L-2/L-3: README + ARCHITECTURE + DECISIONS doc updates for sessions 16-20 — deferred to dedicated doc-sweep session

## 2026-03-16 — Session 19: Audit Fixes

### Work Completed

Applied all Critical + High + selected Medium/Low fixes from the full application audit delivered in Session 18. All 10 changes pass `tsc --noEmit` with zero errors.

**H-5 — Lane intel status filter (`brokerIntelligence.ts`):**
- `getLaneIntelAll` was including Booked/Picked Up/In Transit loads in avgRpm — unconfirmed revenue
- Fixed to `Delivered/Invoiced/Paid` only — lane strength now reflects actual completed loads

**H-7 — `shell:openExternal` URL validation (`ipcHandlers.ts`):**
- Handler now parses the URL with `new URL()` and restricts protocol to `https:`, `http:`, `mailto:`
- Silently returns on invalid URLs or disallowed protocols

**H-2 — `db:query` SELECT-only guard (`ipcHandlers.ts`):**
- Dev-only IPC channel now rejects any SQL that does not begin with `SELECT`
- Returns `{ data: null, error: '...' }` instead of executing writes

**H-4 — React ErrorBoundary (`App.tsx`):**
- Class-based `ErrorBoundary` wraps the entire app above `HashRouter`
- Catches React render errors; shows minimal error screen with message + Reload button instead of blank white window

**H-6 — Migration transaction wrapping (`schema/migrations.ts`):**
- All migration `up()` calls now execute inside `db.transaction(() => m.up(db))()`
- Failed migrations now roll back atomically; no more partial schema states on error

**CAT-C — Remove scheduler stubs (`scheduler.ts`):**
- `runDailyBriefing` and `runMarketingQueue` stub functions removed entirely
- `JOBS` array reduced to just `fmcsa-scraper`; `JobName` type narrowed accordingly
- These jobs will be added back when actually implemented

**L-5 — Type declarations + remove `as any` (`global.d.ts`, `Settings.tsx`):**
- `global.d.ts`: added `backfillLeadData()` to `leads` namespace; added `reseedDocs()` to `dev` namespace
- `Settings.tsx`: both `(window.api.dev as any).reseedDocs()` and `(window.api.leads as any).backfillLeadData()` casts removed

**M-6 — Rename `total_revenue` → `gross_rate` in `LoadRecommendation`:**
- `LoadRecommendation.total_revenue` was the load's single gross rate, not total revenue across multiple loads
- Renamed to `gross_rate` in `models.ts` and `loadScanner.ts`

**CAT-B / M-2 — Business Information editable; remove hardcoded identity:**
- `settingsStore.ts`: initial state defaults and `loadFromStore` fallbacks changed from `'Chris Hooks'` / `'dispatch@ontrackhaulingsolutions.com'` to empty strings
- `Settings.tsx` Business Information section: converted from read-only `ReadField` display to four editable inputs (Company Name, Owner Name, Email, Default Dispatch %) with a Save button
- Save calls `persistSetting` for each field then re-runs `loadFromStore` to sync Zustand state

**L-4 — Inline confirm for Remove Sample Data (`Settings.tsx`):**
- Replaced `window.confirm()` with inline two-step confirm (Confirm/Cancel buttons) matching the existing Backup Restore UI pattern

### Files Modified (10)
- `electron/main/brokerIntelligence.ts`
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts`
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts`
- `electron/main/scheduler.ts`
- `electron/main/loadScanner.ts`
- `src/types/models.ts`
- `src/types/global.d.ts`

- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`

### Build Status
`tsc --noEmit` — exit 0, zero errors

## 2026-03-16 — Session 18: Broker Intelligence + Lane Memory

### Work Completed

**New `brokerIntelligence.ts` service (main process):**
- No schema changes — all data derived from existing `brokers`, `loads`, `drivers` tables
- `getBrokerIntelAll(db)`: per-broker score (0–100) + BrokerRating (Preferred/Strong/Neutral/Caution/Avoid) + caution_note; scoring: base 50 + RPM adjustment (±20 pts) + volume bonus (up to +15 for 5+ loads) + flag modifiers
- `getLaneIntelAll(db)`: aggregate by origin_state/dest_state across Booked+ loads; LaneStrength (Strong/Average/Weak) based on avgRpm and loads count
- `getDriverLaneFits(db, driverId)`: per-driver lane history; DriverLaneFit (Strong Fit/Has History/New Lane) based on run count and avg RPM

**3 new IPC handlers:** `intel:allBrokers`, `intel:allLanes`, `intel:driverFit`

**Types added:**
- `models.ts`: `BrokerRating`, `LaneStrength`, `DriverLaneFit`, `BrokerIntelRow`, `LaneIntelRow`, `DriverLaneFitRow`
- `global.d.ts`: imported new types + `intel` namespace added to `Window.api`

**LoadMatch.tsx updates:**
- Intel fetched on mount (`allBrokers`, `allLanes`) + on driver select (`driverFit`)
- Load cards show intel chips: broker rating + lane strength + driver fit
- Booking workspace adds "Intelligence" section — broker intel (rating, history, caution note), lane intel (strength, avg RPM, run count), driver fit (fit label, run count, avg RPM); section hidden when no intel data exists for the selected load

**BrokerDrawer.tsx updates:**
- Performance section header shows intel rating badge — computed client-side from already-fetched `completedLoads`, `avgRpm`, `broker.flag`; no new IPC call required

**Operations.tsx updates:**
- Top Broker Lanes in Profit Radar now include lane strength label (Strong/Average/Weak) computed client-side from existing `avgRpm` + `loads` data; no new data fetch

### Files Created (1)
- `electron/main/brokerIntelligence.ts`

### Files Modified (7)
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` — import + 3 new handlers
- `electron/preload/index.ts` — `intel` namespace
- `src/types/models.ts` — 6 new types
- `src/types/global.d.ts` — imported new types + `intel` in `Window.api`
- `src/pages/LoadMatch.tsx` — intel state + chips + Intelligence Context panel
- `src/components/brokers/BrokerDrawer.tsx` — rating badge in Performance section
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — lane strength labels in Profit Radar top lanes

### App State at End of Session
- Broker Intelligence: all brokers scored and rated; surfaces in LoadMatch, BrokerDrawer, Operations
- Lane Memory: all lanes classified; surfaces in LoadMatch + Operations Profit Radar
- Driver-Lane Fit: per-driver lane history; surfaces in LoadMatch load cards + booking workspace
- No schema migrations required (all derived data)
- Build: clean (`tsc --noEmit` exit 0)

---

## 2026-03-16 — Session 17: Active Load Timeline + Check Call Engine

### Work Completed

**Duplicate marketing_groups fix:**
- Identified root cause: no UNIQUE constraint on `name`, so `INSERT OR IGNORE` silently inserted duplicates on every HTML import or seed run
- Migration 015: `DELETE FROM marketing_groups WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM ... GROUP BY LOWER(TRIM(name)))` purges all existing duplicates, then `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_marketing_groups_name ON marketing_groups (LOWER(TRIM(name)))` prevents future ones
- `createMarketingGroup()` in `marketingRepo.ts` updated to `INSERT OR IGNORE`; returns existing row if name collides

**Active Load Timeline (new table + service):**
- Migration 016: `load_timeline_events` table with `id, load_id, event_type, label, scheduled_at, completed_at, notes, created_at`; ON DELETE CASCADE on load_id
- `loadTimelineRepo.ts`: full CRUD + auto-scheduling engine + `getActiveLoads()` + `getUpcomingCheckCalls()`
- Auto-scheduling (idempotent, checks existing labels before inserting):
  - Booked → Driver Dispatched check_call (+1h) + Pickup Check Call (pickup day 08:00)
  - Picked Up → Mid-Route Check Call (midpoint) + Delivery ETA Confirm (delivery day 10:00)
  - In Transit → Delivery ETA Confirm (delivery day 10:00)
  - Delivered → POD Request check_call (+30min)

**10 new IPC handlers:**
- `timeline:activeLoads`, `timeline:upcomingCalls`, `timeline:events`, `timeline:addEvent`, `timeline:completeEvent`, `timeline:deleteEvent`, `timeline:statusChange`, `timeline:initLoad`, `timeline:generateMessage` (async Claude Haiku, 4 message types)

**ActiveLoads page (`/activeloads`):**
- Left: scrollable list of Booked/Picked Up/In Transit loads with status badge, route, driver, next event time (overdue = red)
- Right: load header + Next Action panel + Timeline + Status Update form + AI Message Helpers
- Next Action: surfaces first pending event; "Mark Done" action; Call Driver tel: link
- Timeline: pending events first, completed below divider; hover reveals Done/delete; inline note input
- Status Update: "Mark as [NextStatus]" + "Mark Delivered" shortcut; optional note + confirm
- AI Messages: Driver Check-In, Broker Update, POD Request, Delivery Confirm — generated text with Copy

**Operations panel integration:**
- `upcomingCalls` state added; fires independently after main data load
- "Upcoming Check Calls" grid section between KPI strip and Profit Radar — only shown when active events exist; overdue = red; each card navigates to `/activeloads`

**Sidebar:** Active Loads 3rd nav item (Activity icon)

### Files Created (2)
- `electron/main/repositories/loadTimelineRepo.ts`
- `src/pages/ActiveLoads.tsx`

### Files Modified (9)
- `electron/main/schema/migrations.ts` — migration 015 + 016
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` — timeline import + 10 handlers
- `electron/preload/index.ts` — timeline namespace
- `src/types/models.ts` — TimelineEvent, ActiveLoadRow, CheckCallRow
- `src/types/global.d.ts` — timeline in Window.api
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Active Loads nav item
- `src/App.tsx` — ActiveLoads import + route
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — checkCalls state + fetch + Upcoming Check Calls UI
- `electron/main/repositories/marketingRepo.ts` — INSERT OR IGNORE for dedup

### App State at End of Session
- Active Load Timeline: fully operational; auto-scheduling, manual status updates, AI messages all wired
- Upcoming Check Calls: visible on Operations panel when active loads have pending check calls
- Duplicate marketing_groups: purged on next launch, prevented going forward
- All previous pages unchanged and operational
- Build: clean (`tsc --noEmit` exit 0)

---

## 2026-03-16 — Session 16: Load Match + Booking Workspace

### Work Completed

**Load Match page (new guided dispatch workflow at `/loadmatch`):**
- Three-panel layout: drivers (left) — candidate loads (center) — booking workspace (right)
- Reuses existing `scanner.recommendLoads()` and `dispatcher.assignLoad()` — no new DB queries
- Deep-link entry from Operations Profit Radar: idle driver rows navigate to `/loadmatch?driverId=X`; selected driver is auto-set on arrival

**Left panel — Available Drivers:**
- Calls `window.api.scanner.recommendLoads({})` on mount; lists all Active drivers with no current load
- Shows driver name, home base, number of loads matched; selected driver highlighted with orange left border

**Center panel — Candidate Loads:**
- Displays the selected driver's scored load recommendations from `loadScanner.ts`
- Scoring formula (existing): `RPM * 2.0 - deadheadMiles * 0.005`; deadhead estimated by state (same city=10mi, same state=75mi, cross-state=250mi)
- Each card: rank badge, origin→dest, rate, RPM (green ≥ $3.00, orange ≥ $2.50, red below), loaded miles, deadhead, broker name + flag color, pickup date, Strong/Good/Fair/Weak score badge
- Selecting a load opens the right panel workspace

**Right panel — Booking Workspace:**
- Load summary: origin→dest, rate, RPM, driver name
- 6-step booking checklist: Verify broker / Confirm pickup / Agree on rate / Get rate confirmation / Log load / Notify driver — each step toggleable; progress bar shows completion percentage
- Rate analysis table: always visible (rate, RPM color-coded, loaded miles, deadhead)
- Deterministic negotiation opener: computed immediately from RPM vs $2.50/mi floor — if RPM < $2.50, suggests counter-offer with specific dollar amount; otherwise, sends acceptance script
- "AI Script" button: calls `loadMatch:nego` IPC → Claude Haiku for a 2-sentence rate assessment + word-for-word broker opener; appears in an orange-bordered box below deterministic opener; fails gracefully if no API key
- Book Load button: calls `dispatcher.assignLoad()`; glows brighter when all 6 checklist steps are checked; shows error message on failure; success screen shows driver name + "Book another load" / "Back to Operations" options

**New IPC handler:**
- `loadMatch:nego` in `ipcHandlers.ts` — accepts rate/miles/rpm/deadheadMiles/origin/dest/brokerName/driverName; calls `claudeComplete()` with Claude Haiku; returns null if API key absent (deterministic fallback shown in UI)

**Type declarations fixed:**
- `global.d.ts`: Added `operations`, `profitRadar`, and `loadMatch` to `Window.api` interface (the first two were added in Session 15 but missing from the type file)

### Files Created (1)
- `src/pages/LoadMatch.tsx`

### Files Modified (6)
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` — `loadMatch:nego` handler added
- `electron/preload/index.ts` — `loadMatch` namespace exposed
- `src/types/global.d.ts` — `operations`, `profitRadar`, `loadMatch` types added
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Load Match 2nd nav item, `ArrowRightLeft` icon
- `src/App.tsx` — `LoadMatch` import + `/loadmatch` route
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx` — idle driver `onClick` changed to `/loadmatch?driverId=X`

### App State at End of Session
- Load Match: fully operational; driver selection, scored load matching, booking checklist, negotiation support, Book Load all working
- Profit Radar idle driver rows: clicking any driver now opens Load Match pre-selected on that driver
- All previous pages unchanged and operational
- Build: clean (`tsc --noEmit` exit 0)

## 2026-03-16 — Session 15: Operations Control Panel + Profit Radar

### Work Completed

**Operations Control Panel (new default landing page):**
- Merged Dashboard and Operations pages into a single `Operations.tsx` page
- Route `/operations` is now the app default; `/dashboard` redirects to it
- Dashboard removed from sidebar; Operations added as first nav item with Zap icon
- Page sections (top to bottom): KPI briefing strip, Profit Radar, Next Actions + Revenue Opportunities, Daily Checklist + Mini Dispatch Board, Top Leads
- KPI strip extended to 6 cards: FB Inquiries, Loads In Transit, Drivers Available, Overdue Leads, Groups to Post, Open Invoices
- `operations.ts` updated to include `loadsInTransit` count

**Profit Radar (new embedded feature):**
- `profitRadar.ts` — pure data service with four opportunity streams:
  - **Idle Drivers**: Active with no current load; scored 50 base + 20 for known location + 10 for truck type + 5 for home base
  - **FB Lead Heat**: Conversations in active stages (Call Ready=90, Interested=70, Replied=40, New=20) + 25 for overdue follow-up; deterministic `nextAction` per stage
  - **Top Groups**: Ranked by `leads_generated_count * 15 + signed_drivers_count * 25` + priority bonus
  - **Top Broker Lanes**: Aggregate avg RPM from loads table, minimum 2 loads per lane, top 5 by RPM
- `getProfitRadarSummary()` async function: builds concise data brief, calls Claude Haiku with 180 max tokens, returns null if API key not set or call fails
- IPC: `profitRadar:data` (sync) + `profitRadar:summary` (async)
- Preload: `window.api.profitRadar.data()` + `.summary()`
- UI: three-column grid (Idle Drivers | FB Lead Heat | Top Groups) with score badges and click-nav to relevant page; optional broker lanes row at bottom; AI summary strip loads independently after main data (does not block render)

### Files Created (3)
- `electron/main/operations.ts`
- `electron/main/profitRadar.ts`
- `src/pages/Operations.tsx`

### Files Modified (4)
- `electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts` — three new handlers; two new imports
- `electron/preload/index.ts` — `operations` + `profitRadar` namespaces
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Operations first; Dashboard removed; Zap icon
- `src/App.tsx` — new route; redirect for `/dashboard`

### App State at End of Session
- Operations Control Panel: fully operational; all four data sources wired
- Profit Radar: data service clean; AI summary requires Claude API key in Settings
- All previous pages unchanged and operational
- Build: clean (`tsc --noEmit` exit 0)

## 2026-03-15 — Session 14: Marketing Rebuild + FMCSA Improvements + SAFER Links + Docs Sweep + Glossary

### Work Completed

**Marketing tab -- complete rebuild (daily execution system):**
- Migration 009: `marketing_post_log` table (template_id, category, used_date, groups_posted_to JSON, replies_count, leads_generated, notes); `truck_type_tags`, `region_tags`, `active` columns added to `marketing_groups`
- `marketingRepo.ts` rewritten: `updateMarketingGroup`, `listPostLog`, `createPostLog`, `updatePostLog`, `deletePostLog`, `getRecentlyUsedTemplateIds`, `getTemplateUsageCounts`
- 6 new IPC handlers + preload wiring for post log and group update
- `src/lib/marketingUtils.ts` (new): `selectSuggestedTemplate()` (anti-repetition scoring), `generateVariation()` (OPENING_VARIANTS + CTA_VARIANTS), `IMAGE_PROMPTS` (11 categories), `suggestGroupsForPost()`, daily task localStorage helpers
- `Marketing.tsx` complete rewrite: daily checklist, suggested post card with variation/skip/mark-used, LogForm, post history tab, group manager tab with inline edit, template library tab with use counts

**Marketing bug fixes (self-fixed by user in marketingUtils.ts):**
- Expanded `OPENING_VARIANTS` to cover all 11 `PostCategory` values (was 5)
- Removed `isCtaLine` conditional — CTA always replaced unconditionally

**FMCSA SAFER hyperlinks:**
- `src/lib/saferUrl.ts` (new): `saferMcUrl(mc)` and `saferDotUrl(dot)` build SAFER CompanySnapshot URLs
- Wired into: LeadsTable, LeadDrawer, DriversTable, DriverDrawer, BrokersTable, BrokerDrawer, Dashboard
- `window.api.shell.openExternal()` opens links in system browser

**FMCSA scraper improvements:**
- `fmcsaApi.ts`: pagination via `start` offset parameter (3 pages x 50 = up to 150/term), 200ms between pages, early stop when page < 50 results
- `fmcsaImport.ts`: `onlyNewAuthorities = true` parameter; skips carriers with authority date outside 30-180 days
- `DEFAULT_SEARCH_TERMS` updated: TX, GA, IL, TN, OH, FL, IN, PA (top US freight-volume corridor states)

**Industry terms glossary (new feature):**
- `src/data/industryTerms.ts` (new): 60+ terms, 6 categories (Documents, Equipment, Regulatory, Dispatch, Rates & Freight, Business), plain-English definitions
- `Help.tsx` updated: Articles / Glossary tab switcher; Glossary tab: search box, category filter pills, alphabetical `TermCard` list with category color badges

---

## 2026-03-14 — Session 13: Document Library Expansion + Marketing Template Overhaul

### Work Completed

**Document Library — reseedDocuments():**
- `seed.ts`: added `reseedDocuments(db)` — uses INSERT OR REPLACE so it overwrites existing docs 101-108 and adds new docs 109-120
- 20 total documents covering the full business operation at a depth where a novice could follow them
- Docs 101-108 fully rewritten (from short stubs to 400-600 word SOPs): Load Booking SOP, Driver Onboarding Checklist, Invoice Submission Process, Broker Packet Requirements, Driver Safety Compliance, Facebook Driver Search SOP, Warm Lead Follow-Up Script, FMCSA Lead Review Checklist
- New docs 109-120: What Is Freight Dispatch (Reference), Trucking Industry Glossary (Reference), How to Find Loads — Load Board Guide (Reference), Rate Negotiation Guide (SOP), Cold Call Script — First Driver Contact (SOP), Daily Dispatch Routine (SOP), Breakdown and Emergency Procedures (SOP), How to Vet a New Broker (SOP), Explaining Your Dispatch Fee (Training), Reading a Rate Confirmation (Training), Driver Communication Standards (Policy), New Driver Pitch — Converting Leads to Signed (SOP)
- IPC: `dev:reseedDocs` → `reseedDocuments(getDb())`
- Preload: `window.api.dev.reseedDocs()`
- Settings: "Rebuild Document Library" green button with busy/success state

**Marketing Templates — complete rewrite:**
- `src/lib/postTemplates.ts` fully rewritten
- 78 templates total (up from 45) — 2.5 months of unique daily posts before repeat
- 5 new truck-type categories: Dry Van (8), Reefer (7), Flatbed (8), Step Deck (6), Hotshot (6)
- Existing 6 categories retained and rewritten: Driver Recruitment (10), Value Prop (8), Engagement (8), New Authority (7), Trust (5), Freight Market (5)
- All 78 templates: no emojis, no bullet lists with symbols, natural first-person conversational tone
- `CATEGORY_COLORS` expanded with colors for all 5 new truck types
- `Marketing.tsx` `CATEGORY_FILTER_OPTIONS` updated — truck types appear first in filter row

**Project Standards:**
- `CLAUDE.md`: added "Content and Copy Rules — Never Violate" section; no-emoji rule is now a permanent project constraint alongside Git rules

### Files Modified (7)
- electron/main/seed.ts
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts
- electron/preload/index.ts
- src/pages/Settings.tsx
- src/lib/postTemplates.ts

- All other modules unchanged and operational
- Build: clean

---

## 2026-03-14 — Session 12: Auth Sort Fix + Fleet Size + Priority + Invoice Delete + Marketing Tab

### Work Completed

**Auth age sort fix (Leads.tsx):**
- Ascending "Auth Age" sort now means newest (least aged) first — special-cased `authority_date` sort to invert comparison direction so 9mo < 11mo < 1yr in ascending order

**Fleet size + priority:**
- Migration 007: `fleet_size INTEGER` added to leads table
- `fmcsaApi.ts`: SAFER scraper extracts Power Units via regex
- `fmcsaImport.ts`: `computePriority(authorityDate, fleetSize)` — High = 30-180 days AND 1-3 trucks; Medium = one condition; Low = neither; INSERT includes fleet_size and computed priority
- `leadsRepo.ts`: `createLead` and `updateLead` both include fleet_size in SQL
- `models.ts`: `fleet_size` on Lead interface; `CreateLeadDto` omits only dot_number (fleet_size is editable)
- `LeadModal.tsx`: Fleet Size number input
- `LeadsTable.tsx`: fleet size displayed under lead name
- `LeadDrawer.tsx`: Fleet Size row in Contact section

**Backfill (Settings):**
- `backfillLeadData(db)` in `fmcsaImport.ts`: Phase 1 instant SQL re-prioritize all FMCSA leads, Phase 2 SAFER scrape for leads missing fleet_size (150ms delay)
- "Re-enrich & Re-prioritize" button in Settings > Integrations

**Invoice delete:**
- `deleteInvoice` added to `invoicesRepo.ts`
- `InvoiceDrawer.tsx`: Trash2 icon with two-step confirm (matching LeadDrawer pattern)
- `Invoices.tsx`: `handleDelete` wired, closes drawer on success

**Marketing tab (new page):**
- `src/lib/postTemplates.ts`: 45 templates, 6 categories, date-seeded rotation, renderTemplate, CATEGORY_COLORS
- `src/pages/Marketing.tsx`: Today's Post card, category filters, prev/next cycling, copy, Add to Today's Tasks, Group Rotation tracker
- `electron/main/repositories/marketingRepo.ts`: listMarketingGroups, createMarketingGroup, markGroupPosted, deleteMarketingGroup
- Migration 008: marketing_groups table
- IPC + preload: full marketing.groups API

### Files Modified/Created (18)
- src/pages/Leads.tsx, src/lib/postTemplates.ts, src/pages/Marketing.tsx (new)
- electron/main/fmcsaApi.ts, electron/main/fmcsaImport.ts
- electron/main/schema/migrations.ts, electron/main/repositories/leadsRepo.ts

- Invoices: delete with two-step confirm working
- Marketing: fully operational — daily templates, group tracker, task integration
- Build: clean

---

## 2026-03-14 — Session 11: Seed Cleanup + Sample Data Controls

### Work Completed

**seed.ts — three new exported functions:**
- `seedTasksAndDocsOnly(db)` — wraps existing internal `seedTasks()` + `seedDocuments()` in a transaction; INSERT OR IGNORE covers all 18 tasks and 8 documents; never touches brokers/drivers/loads/leads/invoices
- `clearNonTaskSeedData(db)` — deletes id >= 101 from notes, driver_documents, invoices, loads, leads, drivers, brokers (in dependency order); leaves tasks, task_completions, and documents completely untouched
- `seedMissingItems(db)` (from Session 10) — still present; covers tasks 111-118 + docs 106-108

**IPC (ipcHandlers.ts):**
- `dev:seedTasksOnly` → `seedTasksAndDocsOnly(getDb())`
- `dev:clearSeedData` → `clearNonTaskSeedData(getDb())`

**Preload + Types:**
- `window.api.dev.seedTasksOnly()` and `.clearSeedData()` exposed and typed

**Settings page — Sample Data section redesigned:**
- Two-card side-by-side grid layout
- "Load Task Templates" (orange) — calls `seedTasksOnly`; description clearly scoped to tasks and SOPs only
- "Remove Sample Data" (red) — calls `clearSeedData` with `window.confirm` guard; description says tasks + documents are not affected
- `clearBusy` state added; both buttons disabled while either operation is in flight
- `handleSeedData` now calls only `seedTasksOnly` (not the old `seed()` + `seedMissing()` chain)

### Files Modified (5)
- electron/main/seed.ts
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts
- electron/preload/index.ts
- src/types/global.d.ts
- src/pages/Settings.tsx

### App State at End of Session
- "Load Task Templates" button: seeds tasks 101-118 + docs 101-108, safe to repeat, never inserts fake drivers/loads
- "Remove Sample Data" button: strips all seed business data with confirmation dialog
- Build: clean (tsc --noEmit + electron-vite build, 3 green bundles)

## 2026-03-14 — Session 10: CSV Import + v2-Readiness + Recurring Tasks + F12

### Work Completed

**CSV/Paste Lead Import:**
- `electron/main/csvLeadImport.ts` (new): RFC-4180 CSV parser; HEADER_MAP with space-separated aliases (`'driver name'`, `'company name'`, `'trailer type'`); auto header-row detection (scans first 5 lines, picks first with ≥2 mapped tokens); dedup by mc_number; INSERT OR IGNORE
- IPC: `leads:importCsv` (opens file dialog) + `leads:importPaste` (receives raw text)
- `PasteImportModal.tsx` (new): textarea with live row count; calls `window.api.leads.importPaste()`
- Leads toolbar: "Paste Data" + "Import CSV" buttons
- Leads page: result banners (green/amber), dismissible

**v2-Readiness (Migration 005):**
- `migrations.ts`: migration 005 adds `updated_at` to `notes` and `driver_documents` (addColumnIfMissing pattern)
- `dashboard.ts` (new): extracted `getDashboardStats()` service from ipcHandlers
- `db:query` IPC gated behind `!app.isPackaged`
- `syncAdminUserFromStore()` in db.ts: reads ownerName/ownerEmail from electron-store, updates users row 1

**Recurring Tasks + isTaskForToday fix:**
- seed.ts: tasks 111-115 (daily Marketing), tasks 116-118 (Monday/Wednesday/Friday); docs 106-108 (Facebook SOP, Warm Lead Script, FMCSA Checklist)
- `constants.ts`: removed `if (recurring === 1) return true` bug; added DOW array + day-of-week comparison
- `dashboard.ts`: SQL `WHERE due_date = date('now') OR due_date = 'Daily' OR due_date = ?` with todayDow param

**F12 DevTools:**
- `index.ts`: `before-input-event` listener → `mainWindow.webContents.toggleDevTools()` on F12

**`seedMissingItems(db)` (bypass guard for already-seeded DBs):**
- Inserts tasks 111-118 + docs 106-108 via INSERT OR IGNORE; no guard check

### Files Created (3)
- electron/main/csvLeadImport.ts
- electron/main/dashboard.ts
- src/components/leads/PasteImportModal.tsx

### Files Modified (10)
- electron/main/seed.ts

- src/components/tasks/constants.ts
- src/components/leads/LeadsToolbar.tsx
- src/pages/Leads.tsx
- src/pages/Settings.tsx
- src/store/settingsStore.ts

### App State at End of Session
- CSV import: working end-to-end with real Leads.csv files
- Paste import: working for tab-separated spreadsheet data
- 18 recurring tasks seeded (5 daily, 3 weekly, 10 one-time/dated)
- Today view correctly shows only tasks due today (daily + day-of-week match)
- F12 opens DevTools
- Build: clean

### Technical Notes
- `String.fromCharCode()` required for `\r` and `\n` in Python-written TS files on Windows
- HEADER_MAP keys must be lowercase-normalised (trim + toLowerCase)
- `isTaskForToday` — `recurring` flag is display-only; `due_date` is the scheduling field

---

## 2026-03-14 — Session 9: Seed Data System

### Work Completed

**electron/main/seed.ts (new):**
- `runSeedIfEmpty(db)` -- guarded by `app_settings.dev_seed_applied = '1'`; wraps all seeds in a transaction
- `resetAndReseed(db)` -- deletes rows with `id >= 101` from 10 tables, clears guard, re-seeds
- 8 brokers, 15 drivers (9 Active / 4 On Load / 2 Inactive), 40 loads (all 7 statuses), 50 leads (all 5 statuses), 12 invoices, 10 tasks, 5 SOP documents
- Loads span realistic lanes: TX-GA, IL-TX, CA-AZ, MO-CO, TX-TN, GA-IL, MEM-CLT, BNA-CMH -- RPM 1.8-3.2
- Document content stored as single-line TypeScript strings with proper `\n` escape sequences

**Startup (electron/main/index.ts):**
- `runSeedIfEmpty(getDb())` called after `initDatabase()`, wrapped in `!app.isPackaged`

**Dev IPC:**
- `dev:seed` and `dev:reseed` handlers + preload exposure + `global.d.ts` typing

### Files Created (1)
- electron/main/seed.ts

### Files Modified (4)
- electron/main/index.ts
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts
- electron/preload/index.ts
- src/types/global.d.ts

### App State at End of Session
- All pages populated on first dev launch
- Build: clean (zero TS errors on both configs)
- `window.api.dev.reseed()` available in browser console for manual reset

### Technical Notes
- `\\n` in Python heredocs on this Windows system collapses to actual newline -- use `chr(92) + chr(110)` for literal backslash-n in doc content escaping
- SQL `NULL` must be lowercase `null` in TypeScript `.run()` calls

---

## 2026-03-14 — Session 8: FMCSA Manual Import Button

### Work Completed

**FMCSA Manual Import — full IPC pipeline:**
- `electron/main/fmcsaImport.ts` (new) — `FmcsaImportResult` interface + `importFmcsaLeads(db)` function
  - `fetchFmcsaCandidates()` stub returns [] (TODO: wire real Safer API)
  - Dedup by `mc_number` via `SELECT id FROM leads WHERE mc_number = ?`
  - Per-row error handling; early return with error message when 0 candidates
  - Inserts with `source='FMCSA'`, `status='New'`, `priority='Medium'`
- `ipcHandlers.ts` — `leads:importFmcsa` handler calls service, then writes `last_fmcsa_import_at` ISO timestamp to electron-store
- `preload/index.ts` — `leads.importFmcsa: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('leads:importFmcsa')`
- `models.ts` — `FmcsaImportResult { leadsFound, leadsAdded, duplicatesSkipped, errors[] }`
- `global.d.ts` — `importFmcsa: () => Promise<FmcsaImportResult>` on `window.api.leads`

**Leads toolbar + page wiring:**
- Replaced the existing disabled "FMCSA Import" placeholder in `LeadsToolbar.tsx` with active wired button
- Props added: `onImport`, `importBusy`, `lastImportAt`
- Button style: `bg-surface-600 border-surface-400` at rest, `hover:border-orange-600/40` — matches app token system
- Spinner shown during import; last import timestamp shown as native title tooltip
- `Leads.tsx`: `handleImport()` calls IPC, stores result + timestamp, conditionally reloads table
- `lastImportAt` loaded on mount from `window.api.settings.get('last_fmcsa_import_at')`
- Dismissible result banner between header and toolbar: amber = error/stub, green = success

### Files Created (1)
- electron/main/fmcsaImport.ts

### Files Modified (6)
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts
- electron/preload/index.ts
- src/types/models.ts
- src/types/global.d.ts
- src/components/leads/LeadsToolbar.tsx
- src/pages/Leads.tsx

### App State at End of Session
- FMCSA import button live in Leads toolbar, end-to-end IPC working
- Stub returns 0 leads with "not yet connected" message — expected behavior
- `last_fmcsa_import_at` persisted to electron-store and surfaced in UI on next load
- All prior modules unchanged and operational
- Build: clean

### Known Issues / Deferred
- `fetchFmcsaCandidates()` is a stub — no real API call yet
- Real Safer API integration is next step when credentials/access are available

---

## 2026-03-14 -- Prompt 7: Tasks Module + Backup Service + Scheduler + Dashboard Bug Fix

### Work Completed

**Tasks Module (full CRUD + completion tracking):**
- TasksToolbar -- view tabs (Today / All Tasks / History), progress bar (X of Y / %), search + category filter, Add Task button
- TaskModal -- create/edit: title, category, priority, due_date (accepts 'Daily' or YYYY-MM-DD), time_of_day, recurring toggle, notes
- TaskDrawer -- slide-in: mark complete/incomplete for today, completion history (last 30 logged), edit, two-step delete
- Tasks.tsx -- three views: Today checklist (large checkboxes + priority dots + time badges), All Tasks table (sortable, filterable), 30-day History (which tasks were done each day shown as tag pills)
- Completion persisted by day via task_completions table; recurring tasks independently checkable each day
- New IPC: tasks:completionsForDate(date) -- returns all completions for a given date (used for Today + History views)

**Automation Scheduler (scaffolded):**
- electron/main/scheduler.ts -- minute-tick setInterval, zero new npm packages
- Three jobs: fmcsa-scraper @ 05:00, daily-briefing @ 06:00, marketing-queue @ Mon 07:00
- Each job guarded by last_run key in app_settings -- fires at most once per day
- All job handlers are stubs with TODO comments; no external API calls yet
- Started in index.ts on app ready, stopped on window-all-closed

**Backup Service:**
- electron/main/backup.ts -- standalone module extracted from db.ts
- Auto daily backup: YYYY-MM-DD.db -- on startup, skips if already exists
- Periodic 6-hour backup: YYYY-MM-DD_auto-00/06/12/18.db -- up to 5 restore points per day
- Manual backup: YYYY-MM-DD_manual.db -- via Settings UI button
- Staged restore flow: stageRestore() saves path to electron-store; applyPendingRestore() runs at NEXT startup before DB is opened (WAL-safe, no concurrent write risk)
- Backup records written to backups table (best-effort, does not block)
- listBackups() reads filesystem directly -- works even if DB table is empty

**Settings -- Backup & Restore UI:**
- Lists all .db files in backups/ dir with filename + size
- Two-step confirm: Restore -> 'Confirm restore?' -> 'Yes, stage it'
- After staging: yellow banner shows 'Restart OnTrack to apply'
- 'Create Backup Now' button for on-demand backup
- Google Drive Sync section: explicit conflict warning about WAL + concurrent write risk

**Dashboard Bug Fix -- driversNeedingLoads:**
- Root cause: query was SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drivers WHERE status = 'Active' -- counted all Active drivers with no awareness of loads
- Fix: NOT EXISTS correlated subquery excludes Active drivers who already have a load in Booked / Picked Up / In Transit
- File: electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts, dashboard:stats handler

### Files Created (7 new)
- electron/main/backup.ts
- electron/main/scheduler.ts
- src/components/tasks/constants.ts
- src/components/tasks/TasksToolbar.tsx
- src/components/tasks/TaskModal.tsx
- src/components/tasks/TaskDrawer.tsx
- src/pages/Tasks.tsx (replaced PagePlaceholder stub)

### Files Modified (8)
- electron/main/db.ts -- added getDataDir() export, wired createBackup + startPeriodicBackup
- electron/main/index.ts -- wired startScheduler, stopScheduler, stopPeriodicBackup, applyPendingRestore
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts -- added backup IPC handlers, tasks:completionsForDate, fixed driversNeedingLoads query
- electron/main/repositories/tasksRepo.ts -- added getCompletionsForDate()
- electron/preload/index.ts -- exposed backups + tasksExtra namespaces
- src/types/global.d.ts -- added BackupEntry interface + backups/tasksExtra API surface
- src/pages/Settings.tsx -- full rewrite: added Backup & Restore section + Google Drive Sync section
- docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/SESSION_LOG.md

### App State at End of Session
- Tasks page: fully operational (Today checklist, All Tasks, History, CRUD, completion persistence)
- Backup: auto daily + 6-hour periodic + manual; staged restore via Settings UI
- Scheduler: wired and running; job stubs ready for API implementation
- Dashboard 'Needs Load' KPI: corrected -- excludes drivers with active loads
- Build: clean (1527 modules, zero errors)
- Remaining stubs: Documents, Marketing, Analytics, Help

### Technical Notes
- Restore is staged (not immediate) to avoid opening DB while copying over it
- listBackups() reads from filesystem, not DB table, for reliability
- scheduler.ts uses setInterval at 60s tick + last_run guard -- no node-cron dependency
- All file writes this session used Python heredoc (Windows EEXIST constraint applies)
- Scheduler getDb reference uses require() to avoid circular import at module load time

### Known Issues at End of Session
- No seed data -- pages show empty state
- Dashboard mini dispatch board still uses old driver count (needs refresh after KPI fix)
- Email workflow uses mailto: (SMTP deferred)
- FMCSA/briefing/marketing job handlers are stubs

---

Reverse-chronological. Most recent session at the top.

## 2026-03-14 -- Prompt 6: Brokers Module + Invoices Module

### Work Completed

**Brokers Module (full profile + performance):**
- BrokersToolbar -- search, flag filter, broker count, Add Broker button
- BrokersTable -- sortable 8-column table; late-payer highlight (red when avg_days_pay > payment_terms + 5)
- BrokerModal -- create/edit: all 9 fields (name, MC #, flag, phone, email, payment terms, credit rating, avg days pay, notes)
- BrokerDrawer -- 500px slide-in: contact/payment, inline flag switcher, performance metrics (total loads, revenue, avg RPM), load history (up to 12), notes
- Brokers.tsx -- orchestrator: search/filter/sort, delete, flag change

**Invoices Module (full lifecycle + export):**
- InvoicesToolbar -- search, status filter, outstanding fee badge, Generate Invoice button
- InvoicesTable -- 9-column table; auto-detects Overdue (sent_date > 30 days with no payment)
- InvoiceModal -- generate/edit: auto-generated invoice number (INV-YYYY-NNNN), load dropdown (Delivered/Invoiced/Paid only), auto-fills driver + gross + dispatch % + week ending, fee auto-calculated
- InvoiceDrawer -- status actions (Mark Sent/Paid/Overdue), Print PDF (window.print() with injected CSS), CSV Export (client-side Blob download), Email workflow (mailto: pre-filled), financials card, notes
- Invoices.tsx -- orchestrator: status cascade (invoice Paid/Sent updates linked load), outstanding total, search

**Types:**
- models.ts -- BrokerFlag extended with "Slow Pay" and "Blacklisted"

### Files Created (10 new)
- src/components/brokers/constants.ts
- src/components/brokers/BrokersToolbar.tsx
- src/components/brokers/BrokersTable.tsx
- src/components/brokers/BrokerModal.tsx
- src/components/brokers/BrokerDrawer.tsx
- src/components/invoices/constants.ts
- src/components/invoices/InvoicesToolbar.tsx
- src/components/invoices/InvoicesTable.tsx
- src/components/invoices/InvoiceModal.tsx
- src/components/invoices/InvoiceDrawer.tsx

### Files Modified (3)
- src/types/models.ts -- extended BrokerFlag union
- src/pages/Brokers.tsx -- replaced PagePlaceholder stub
- src/pages/Invoices.tsx -- replaced PagePlaceholder stub

### App State at End of Session
- Brokers: fully operational (list, CRUD, drawer, flag management, load history, performance metrics)
- Invoices: fully operational (list, generate from load, edit, print PDF, CSV export, email, status lifecycle)
- Invoice status cascade: marking invoice Paid/Sent updates linked load status automatically
- Build: clean (1523 modules, zero errors)
- Remaining stubs: Tasks, Documents, Marketing, Analytics, Help

### Technical Notes
- PDF export: window.print() with dynamically injected @media print CSS -- no new deps
- CSV export: client-side Blob + URL.createObjectURL -- no new IPC handlers
- Email: mailto: link pre-filled with invoice details -- SMTP config deferred to Settings
- Windows write constraint: avoid escape sequences (
) in Python-written JS; use String.fromCharCode(10) instead
- Always use encoding='utf-8' AND newline='' when writing JS/TS files via Python on Windows

### Known Issues at End of Session
- No seed data -- pages show empty until real data is entered
- Email workflow uses mailto: (default mail client) -- SMTP deferred
- Invoice history per driver accessible via search filter (no dedicated driver tab yet)

## 2026-03-13 — Prompt 5: Drivers Module + Loads Module + Dispatch Board

### Work Completed

**Drivers Module (full profile + documents):**
- `DriversToolbar` — search, status filter (Active / On Load / Inactive), driver count, Add Driver button
- `DriversTable` — sortable 9-column table: Driver, Company, Status, MC #, Equipment, Home Base, Min RPM, CDL Exp, Ins. Exp; expiry warning badges (orange, 60-day window); hover row actions
- `DriverModal` — create/edit modal: all 19 driver fields across 4 sections (Contact, Carrier Info, Equipment, Dispatch Settings) including min_rpm, dispatch %, factoring company, preferred lanes
- `DriverDrawer` — 500px slide-in detail panel: current load banner (Booked/Picked Up/In Transit), contact, carrier (MC#/DOT#/CDL# with expiry warnings), equipment, dispatch settings (min RPM + preferred lanes), linked documents (add/delete with doc type + expiry), notes
- `Drivers.tsx` — orchestrator: search/filter/sort state, status change, delete

**Loads Module (full lifecycle):**
- `LoadsToolbar` — search, status filter (all 7 statuses), load count, table/board toggle, Add Load
- `LoadsTable` — sortable 9-column table: Load #, Driver (unassigned highlight), Route (origin→dest), Miles, Rate, RPM (green if meets driver min, red if below), Pickup, Delivery, Status
- `LoadModal` — create/edit modal: driver dropdown, broker dropdown, route (city+state each end), schedule, miles, rate with live RPM preview, dispatch %, commodity, status, notes
- `LoadDrawer` — 480px slide-in: "Mark [Next Status]" action button, route card (origin→dest), financials (rate, RPM with min-RPM comparison, dispatch %, dispatch fee), assignment (driver + broker), notes

**Dispatch Board:**
- Embedded in Loads page as a second view (table ↔ board toggle in toolbar)
- Responsive card grid (1/2/3/4 columns by breakpoint)
- Each card: driver name, company, status badge, equipment chips, home base
- "Needs Load" highlight (orange glow border, pulsing dot) for Active drivers with no current load
- Drivers on load: clickable load card showing status badge + route + pickup date + RPM (green/red)
- Inactive drivers: dimmed (opacity-50)
- Sort order: Active drivers first, then unloaded before loaded

**Dashboard Mini Dispatch Board (updated):**
- Now fetches real driver + load data in a second parallel useEffect
- Compact list of up to 6 drivers, sorted: Active-unloaded first
- Shows status badge, current load status + route, or "Needs Load" pulse indicator

**Data model:**
- `LoadStatus` union extended with "Paid" (7th lifecycle stage)
- No schema changes, no IPC changes — all relationships joined client-side

### Files Created (10 new)
- src/components/drivers/constants.ts
- src/components/drivers/DriversToolbar.tsx
- src/components/drivers/DriversTable.tsx
- src/components/drivers/DriverModal.tsx
- src/components/drivers/DriverDrawer.tsx
- src/components/loads/constants.ts
- src/components/loads/LoadsToolbar.tsx
- src/components/loads/LoadsTable.tsx
- src/components/loads/LoadModal.tsx
- src/components/loads/LoadDrawer.tsx

### Files Modified (4)
- src/types/models.ts — added "Paid" to LoadStatus union
- src/pages/Drivers.tsx — replaced PagePlaceholder stub
- src/pages/Loads.tsx — replaced stub; includes Loads table + DispatchBoard component
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx — updated mini dispatch board to show real driver/load data

### App State at End of Session
- Drivers page: fully operational (list, create, edit, drawer, status workflow, documents, notes)
- Loads page: fully operational (list + dispatch board view, create, edit, drawer, status workflow, RPM calc, notes)
- Dashboard: mini dispatch board shows real data
- Brokers, Invoices, Tasks, Documents, Marketing, Analytics, Help: still PagePlaceholder stubs
- No new IPC handlers needed — all relationships joined client-side
- No schema migration needed — LoadStatus "Paid" is TypeScript-only

### Known Issues at End of Session
- TypeScript generic helpers in modals (`num`, `str`) may produce minor TS warnings (not build errors)
- No seed data — Drivers/Loads pages will show empty state until Chris adds real data
- Dispatch Board "Needs Load" KPI on Dashboard still counts all Active drivers (not just those without loads)
- Task completion on Dashboard still visual-only (not persisted)

## 2026-03-13 — Prompt 4: Leads Module + Task Sort Fix

### Prompt 4 Complete
- Leads table view built
- Kanban board built
- Lead detail panel/form built
- Search/filter UX added
- Ready for Prompt 5

### Work Completed

**Leads Module (full CRM pipeline):**
- `LeadsTable` — sortable columns (Score, Lead, Status, MC #, Phone, Trailer, Auth Age, Follow-Up, Priority, Source), loading skeletons, empty state, hover row actions
- `LeadsKanban` — 5 status columns (New → Contacted → Interested → Signed → Rejected), card advance button on hover, loading skeletons, no drag-and-drop dependency
- `LeadsToolbar` — search with clear, status/priority/source/overdue filters, Table ↔ Board view toggle, disabled FMCSA Import placeholder, Add Lead button
- `LeadModal` — create/edit form with all 14 fields (name, company, MC #, phone, email, city, state, trailer type, authority date, source, status, priority, follow-up date, notes)
- `LeadDrawer` — slide-in detail panel: contact details, action bar (Edit/Call/→Status/Delete), overdue banner, Notes section (add/delete), Call Log section (type, outcome, duration, summary), collapsible Score Breakdown
- `LeadScoreBadge` — Hot/Warm/Cold badge computed client-side from 8 weighted factors (0–100)
- `leadScore.ts` — pure compute function, no DB column, no migration needed
- `fmcsa.ts` — clean import hook placeholder for future FMCSA API integration
- `constants.ts` — STATUS_STYLES, PRIORITY_STYLES, STATUSES, PRIORITIES, TRAILER_TYPES, LEAD_SOURCES
- `Leads.tsx` — orchestrator page wiring all components with search/filter/sort state and IPC handlers
- Call logs stored in existing `notes` table using `entity_type = 'lead_call'` with JSON content — no new table or migration
- Added `'lead_call'` to `NoteEntityType` union in `models.ts`

**Bug fix — Task sort order regression:**
- Root cause: `ORDER BY time_of_day ASC` in SQLite sorts lexicographically — `'10:30 AM'` sorts before `'9:00 AM'` because `'1' < '9'`
- Fix: removed `time_of_day` from all SQL `ORDER BY` clauses in `tasksRepo.ts`; added `timeToMin()` + `sortTasks()` helpers to sort by parsed minutes-since-midnight in JS
- Same fix applied to `dashboard:stats` `todayTasks` query in `ipcHandlers.ts`

### Files Created
- src/lib/leadScore.ts
- src/lib/fmcsa.ts
- src/components/leads/constants.ts
- src/components/leads/LeadScoreBadge.tsx
- src/components/leads/LeadsToolbar.tsx
- src/components/leads/LeadsTable.tsx
- src/components/leads/LeadsKanban.tsx
- src/components/leads/LeadModal.tsx
- src/components/leads/LeadDrawer.tsx
- src/pages/Leads.tsx

### Files Modified
- src/types/models.ts — added `'lead_call'` to NoteEntityType
- electron/main/repositories/tasksRepo.ts — replaced SQL time sort with JS sort helpers
- electron/main/ipcHandlers.ts — fixed dashboard:stats todayTasks sort

### App State at End of Session
- Leads page fully operational: table view, kanban board, create/edit modal, detail drawer
- Lead scoring computed client-side, no schema changes required
- Call logs and notes persisted to DB via existing notes table
- Task sort order correct: 9:00 AM → 10:30 AM → 1:00 PM (chronological)
- Dashboard, Drivers, Loads, Brokers, Invoices, Tasks pages still on placeholder stubs
- Dashboard rebuild plan approved but not yet implemented (deferred)

### Known Issues at End of Session
- Dashboard is still the original minimal scaffold (rebuild planned, not started)
- Task completion in Dashboard is visual-only (not persisted)
- FMCSA import is a disabled placeholder
- All non-Leads CRUD pages remain as PagePlaceholder stubs

## 2026-03-12 — Foundation Complete + Bug Fixes + Grounding Docs

### Work Completed
- Resolved all build errors carried over from prior session:
  - Fixed `\!` bash escape artifacts in settingsStore.ts and authStore.ts
  - Replaced deprecated `externalizeDepsPlugin()` with explicit `rollupOptions.external`
  - Main bundle dropped from 554 KB (electron bundled in) to 9.64 KB
- Resolved Electron/better-sqlite3 native module incompatibility:
  - Downgraded Electron from 41.0.1 → 32.3.3 LTS
  - Upgraded better-sqlite3 from v9 → v12.6.2
  - Added @electron/rebuild + postinstall script
- Resolved `window.api` undefined bug:
  - Identified that `"type":"module"` causes Electron 32 to lose preload ESM detection
  - Reverted to `.mjs` output (no package.json type field)
  - Converted postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js to CJS module.exports
- Added React Router v7 future flags to suppress deprecation warnings
- Fixed duplicate daily tasks on every app launch:
  - Root cause: INSERT OR IGNORE without explicit ID — no PK conflict, always inserts
  - Fix: explicit IDs 1–6 in INSERT + dedup DELETE before INSERT
- Fixed task timestamp hidden until hover:
  - Root cause: opacity-0 + group-hover:opacity-100 Tailwind classes
  - Fix: removed those classes
- Fixed task sort order (alphabetic → chronological):
  - Root cause: ORDER BY time_of_day is alphabetic — "9:00 AM" > "4:30 PM"
  - Fix: CASE expression converting H:MM AM/PM → minutes-since-midnight integer
- Fixed sidebar collapse button being cut off:
  - Root cause: overflow-hidden on aside clipping absolute -right-3 button
  - Fix: removed overflow-hidden from aside (labels are conditionally rendered)
- Saved standing project instructions to MEMORY.md
- Created all grounding docs: CLAUDE.md + docs/ folder with 5 files

## Prior Sessions

### Pre-2026-03-12 — Initial Scaffold

Full project scaffold built from scratch:
- Electron + electron-vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup
- SQLite schema (8 tables), WAL mode, auto-backup
- All IPC channels registered
- AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar layout
- Dashboard and Settings pages
- Zustand stores, electron-store, HashRouter
- 12 routes registered
